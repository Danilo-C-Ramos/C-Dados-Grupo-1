This method isn’t reliable since the copper sulfate solution and isopropyl alcohol don’t mix so it only works when the water is hot and it needs stirring to keep it mixed.

">lower chance doesn't mean no chance\n\nAs OP said, his friend isn't an idiot. I would assume he knows this, but what it boils down to really is how much contact you have with people, which he isn't saying.\n\n>The mRNA gets replicated in the cell's cytoplasm/ribosome. Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that. Nothing scientific, not even theoretical. There is a bad flu going around this year, that's true though.\n\nI agree. Personal observation & experience is one of the absolute worst forms of scientific evidence\n\n>That was a surprise for me too. But the endpoints and outcomes of the protocol were approved and the trial results met the efficacy and safety standards. None of which were altered because of COVID. These are done by independent review boards and have to declare no conflicts of interest. There has also been failed mRNA COVID vaccines too, but that's less in the news. (Sanofi, Merck and GSK.)\n\nTechnically I believe the vaccines are still in phase 4. Correct me if I'm wrong. But to add to that, even looking at the MINIMUM timelines for each phase, it's over 2 years. I'm not sure when exactly they started, but I dont think it was October 2019\n\n>I can't speak on this particular local doctor's experience or anything. But the adverse events of the vaccines are readily available for you to review.\n\nNow this is a tough one. Again it kind of goes back to personal experiences, but at the same time, this is all so new and so much data at coming in all at once, it would be next to impossible to determine ALL of the adverse effects. Adding to that, unless science have developed a time machine, long term effects, even though extremely unlikely would be exactly impossible to know.",Biology

"Concentration is what mass of a compound you have per unit volume of solvent; if i have a concentration of 1 g/L in water, that means I have 1 gram of my compound for every liter of water.\n\nPurity, on the other hand, just refers to how much other stuff is in a compound. For example, a lot of the compounds I acquire for lab work are 99.9% pure. That means for every 100 g of the compound, 0.1 g is contamination of things that aren't the compound I bought. \n\nPurity can relate to concentration, as your actual concentration will be slightly lower than your calculated concentration when preparing solutions. For my 1 g/L solution, if the compound I added to water was 99.9% pure, the actual concentration of the solution is 0.999 g/L, as the other 0.001 g/L is not my desired compound.",Chemistry
"Part of the issue is your eyes, rather than limitations of VR. Ultimately all light coming into your eyes is focused onto your retinas, which are 2D surfaces. So even in your current 3D world you see a 2D representation of it. In a 4D world you would also see a 2D slice.\n\nNow imagine you live in a 2D world on a piece of paper, here your retina would be a line segment. If someone proposed adding a 3rd dimension in a simulation you'd need a way of rotating your field of view ""upwards"" so the line segment could receive information from out of the plane but you'd still only see in 1D. This upwards rotation would be an alien concept to you much like the operation needed to go from 3D to 4D is to us. \n\nHaving said that, yes I think you could define some operation that would allow you to move through a 4th dimension in a video game. What that would look like I have no idea. However, you would still be looking at a reduced representation of 4D space, you'd render 3 dimensions and then see that in 2D. \n\nThere's a few videos on YouTube of simple shapes in 4D, try searching 4D simulation.

Also cancer “in remission” is a relative thing as is the definition of “cure” in the field of oncology, as such it would be very difficult to show causation from a biologically implausible source. \nmRNA vaccines use a standard metabolic pathway for what it is designed to do.

"I’m familiar with Hoppes from a past life - back then I stored the bottles in a hermetically sealed metal container (actually an old ammunition box). I wouldn’t keep bottles of it in the house, mainly because of the risk of dropping the bottle and breaking it. I’m also familiar with safety data sheets and (in the UK the ‘Control of Substances Hazardous to Health’) from my time in labs. Solvents such as amyl acetate (one of the components) can attack some plastics, so probably that component leached through the plastic zip bag. The smell is quite penetrating, so that’s probably what you can smell. I doubt if you will have any adverse effects, as the double bagging would have reduced the amount of solvent escaping considerably. Some people can smell it at lower concentrations than others, but judging from your description it seems unlikely that you had a significant exposure. Faintly smelling it doesn’t sound to me to be a lot if exposure. You can google exposure limits of the different components you’ll see in the safety data sheet for further information.\nKeep your closet door open, and open the window in that room for a while. The smell should slowly dissipate. If I were you, I would store solvents like that in your garage if you have one.

They live in communal burrows, with some species having hundreds or even thousands of individuals in the colony.  They mostly eat seeds and some leaves and flowers, plus bugs, eggs, nuts or discarded French fries.

"There’s an interesting neutron lifetime “puzzle”, where different types of experiments measure different values for the lifetime. Bottle experiments (like this one, which measure neutrons that **do not** decay) measure a lifetime about 10 s less than beam experiments (which measure neutrons that **do** decay). This could be due to experimental error, or a 1% branching ratio to some exotic decay channel. This result doesn’t help resolve this puzzle.\n\nImproved precision helps probe CKM unitarity. Also, the neutron lifetime is an important parameter in Big Bang nucleosynthesis because it determines the ratio of protons to neutrons prior to the beginning of formation of heavier nuclei.\n\nThe neutron source is rad hot. We use a 800 MeV proton beam to produce spallation neutrons, and then cool them to UCN energy levels. Solid D2 is used in the final step to downscatter cold neutrons to ultracold neutrons. This all happens under a shield stack of concrete and steel.",Physics

"Yes, you are measuring things.  Two differing reference frames, time, and The speed of the bullet in those reference frames, For starters.\n\nHow they get ""synced together"" (not a good phrase, but I'm going with it) isn't by doubling the speed of the bullet.  It is by using a Lorentz Transformation.  When the above posters talk about blue shifted light coming from the bullet this is related.  Due to the nature space-time warping at relativistic speeds the energies involved become a hindrance thus creating a cost for objects of mass in typical space-time system where they can't reach c.  As it creates an asymptotic energy cost to reach c.  Leaving us with a situation where it would look to the observer always less than c.  \n\nSo the observer would see, as you correctly said, the bullet travel from the gun to them in 10 seconds.  \n\nBut\n\nThe bullet would take a different time, differing reference frames and all that.  \n\nSo how do we rectify the two?  Which is where I think your question lies.  \n\nEvery time step (1 sec) light or some bit of information leaves the bullet AT the speed of light and reaches the observer.  It will always reach them first.  So, for the entire trip light is signaling the arrival of the bullet before the bullet in the bullets reference frame to the observer in the observers reference frame.  And since the bullet only goes 0.5c (and none faster) those bits of photons going c tell us the bullet never went c, regardless of how we experienced it.  \n\nLuckily we have blue shift and other measurements to tell us this rather accurately.  Because if we see, hear, feel, the bullet we have measured it.",Physics

"I'll attempt to answer your question in the most straight forward and simplistic way I can.  I'll avoid getting too detailed so you can wrap your mind around the basic concept of viruses. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nViruses don't ""want"" anything or have goals, motives, desires or intent. Viruses exist to only to replicate. \n\nViruses are completely reliant on a host to do the replication for them. \n\nVirulence is a human created term to categorize the severity of illness caused by a viral infection. \n\nSome viruses cause little, if any, ill effect on the host.\n\nSome viruses cause the host to fall ill for prolonged periods of time. \n\nSome viruses can infect a host for the duration of the host's life. \n\nSome viruses can cause severe acute illness followed by death. \n\nSome viruses infect a host just once but leave the host forever scarred or with significant long-term health issues \n\nMany viruses are host specific, meaning they can only infect a certain specie(s).  \n\nViruses infect very specific cellular systems within the host specie(s).  \n\nThoes infected cells are ""hijacked"" by the viral genetic information and given instruction to replicate the virus over and over and over again until the infected cell bursts with millions of copies of the virus.  \n\nThe replicated viral copies quickly infect the adjoining cells and the process repeats until either all the cells are destroyed or the immune system of the host gets the viral invasion under control. \n\nMutations during the replication process drive the evolution and success of viruses. \n\nThe more the virus is able to replicate, the higher the probability of a mutation occurring. \n\nMutation are caused by errors made in the replication process.  Nearly all mutations are unsuccessful dead-ends for the virus. \n\nSome chance random mutations may make the virus more successful. \n\nA ""beneficial"" mutation may give a virus ability to replicate at a greater rate, in greater numbers, infect different cellular systems or even infect other species.\n\nWhen a virus mutates to infect a new  specie(s), it becomes a novel virus for the new host(s). \n\nA novel virus can be highly virulent on a new host because the new host has no immunity to combat the virus. \n\nA novel virus can replicate unchecked within the new host specie because there is no ""programed"" immune response to combat the novel viral infection.  \n\nWhen a virus is given the opportunity to replicate unimpeded, the probability of a successful mutations increases. \n\nAs the virus mutates through host replication, it may become more virulent on the host. \n\nIf a virus is overly virulent on its host, it often leads to an evolutionary dead end - in other words, if all the hosts are killed by a virus, the virus won't be able to replicate and will go extinct.\n\nOver time, natural selection tends to favor the mutations that make virus more transmissible over mutations that make it more virulent. \n\nThe most successful viruses are ones that have evolved to be highly transmissible but have minimal virulent effects on the host. \n\nSome viruses can be highly virulent on certain individuals in the host population and have no virulent impact on other individuals within the same population. \n\nOver time, the genetic traits in thoes unaffected individuals will be passed along to subsequent generations and become the dominant trait within the host population.  \n\nThis relationship between viruses and their hosts has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years. It's known as an evolutionary ""arms race"". \n\nViruses have always, and will continue to always be one of the selection factors driving the evolution and diversity of species on our planet.  \n\n----------------------------------\n\nAgain, I tried to make the information very simple and loose.  I left our a tremendous amount of information in hopes to provide some insight without confusion.",Biology

I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me.

Well water itself is made of 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen and gases can dissolve in water as well. Look at soda drinks it has co2 in it. Water is full of it…..you could inhale water and get a tiny tiny tiny fraction of oxygen but you would not be able to keep up with the demand and water acts as an irritant in lungs because the structure isn’t suited to deal with getting oxygen from water. You can get water into lungs easy but not so much getting it out…and in order to take another breathe you need to get it out so you drown because you can’t keep up with the demand. You would need to breathe an ungodly amount of water per second to get enough oxygen and lungs just can’t do that.,Biology

"So I take that as a No that if you put a supplement B vitamin Liquid in a nebulizer it won't work. Or if you inject them directly into the blood it won't work either. I was under the impression that nebulizer did break them down to individual atoms via vibrations or something. But the nebulizer still can make the B vitamins carry it a steam by making them as a whole into small enough particles that can be carried and absorbed, and if it gets to the LUNGS which are equipped to separate OXYGEN atoms from the other things in the air and absorb, why can't it do the same for the vitamin supplement that have other ingredients mixed in with them that are attached and then get rid of those (as it does with carbon, hydrogen etc from oxygen) and absorb the essential vitamins which your body recognizes ? But if you inject them directly without first separating all the individual ingredients  and making them into a small particle it won't work? Because once in the blood it cant separate or use enzymes to make it into a usable form particle? And also the lungs can alter PH levels. Vitamin C for example is made out of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. So your telling me the lungs won't absorb vitamin C because it has hydrogen and carbon? Doesn't the lungs absorb some carbon and hydrogen accidently?  But then again your lungs do absorb smoke and all its chemicals from cigars into blood even though it is not meant to it still does.\n\n>Why does it feel like I'm doing your homework? For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms not particles. You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against. You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another. The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible. That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur. It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process. Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting. Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules. Again at this point you are really talking chemistry more than biology. As for PH levels affecting absorption rates yes it plays a huge role but again this will be dependent upon the vitamin in question. Again this would depend on the vitamin in question, some are water soluble whereas others are oil soluble. Vibration on the molecular level is heat. Such a miniscule amount of vibration on tiny granules isn't going to do much to change them. This would be a physical change but common filler ingredient such as microcrystalline cellulose or maltodextrin are used for the aforementioned uniformity in granule size and wouldn't be affected by such vibrations but they will be broken down in your digestive system by chemical processes some as simple as being dissolved in water and other bodily fluids.",Biology

Instead, glucose can be converted into glycogen, which is a fuel-storage molecule. \n\nGlycogen stores are limited, but fat stores are virtually infinite, so if you overeat, your body tends to start producing fat stores.

I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nIt's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution.

"So it sounds like your less confused about why it's exothermic and more confused about how a metastable system can change phase exothermically. But the thermodynamics doesn't care. Thermodynamics only states how energy will change eventually, there's absolutely no timeline on that change. In other words, thermodynamics states that when the solution crystallizes, it will be exothermic by X amount. That could happen immediately if you cool it too fast and don't achieve that metastable state, or it could happen the moment you give a metastable state a nucleation site. That energy is coming from all the interactions formed and lost (lost interactions with water, gained bonds between ions, in this case), so that energy comes only comes into play when it actually crystallizes. \n\nI'm not going to explain why crystallizing sodium acetate is exothermic here.

It is different from other meal moth species, including the common meal moth, Pyralis farinalis. Adults are tricolored above, wavy patterned below, and with the tiny abdomen tip held at about 90 degrees to body plane. Now pantropical (and in warm temperate regions), it may have originated in Central America.\n\nTheir diet is unusually broad, including grains and many foods made with at least some grain including cereals, breads, muffins, pasta, pet food, bird seed, but apparently also some nuts, candy bars, peanut butter, possibly starches such as corn starch, tapioca, etc.\n\nThe peak adult activity is around dusk. During daytime the adults mostly remain inactive in dark spots (e.g. crevices). Adults are moderately attracted to light, especially in the blue to violet range.\n\nThey are readily detectable using pheremone traps (scented tent-traps). Deter them by using airtight, adequate  food containers or double bagging, as well as using essential oils and nontoxic pantry moth spray. All stages including eggs are readily killed in a short time by temperatures over c. 130°F (e.g. in a car in the sun on a hot day) or freezing for 72 hours.\n\nUnlike most meal moths, the larvae of this species readily chew through paper, some plastics including processed-cereal freshness liners, and even thin cardboard. Double-bagging with Ziplock bags is normally adequate unless populations are large. Tupperware style containers only work if they completely seal (""airtight"").

"Disagree. I'm not a knee-jerk anti-nuclear wingnut, but given the dramatic progress in intermittent renewables over the past decade, the use-case for nuclear is substantially smaller than many redditors seem to think it is. There's certainly a good case to be made for nuclear power for clean load-following or baseload electricity generation, but that's about it. My experience is mostly limited to American energy policy, but there's not much reason to believe other countries would have it substantially better when even the French nuclear industry is broadly declining.\n\nDue to the numerous safety regulations governing nuclear power plant construction, upkeep, and decommissioning (which, for the record, I think are a good thing), nuclear power plants are expensive as hell and take forever to build. kWh for kWh, they simply cannot compete economically with cheap silicon PV. Even if they could, a primarily nuclear energy industry would require new power plants being finished across the country every few days just to keep up with the rate at which they'd be decommissioned. Given how long they take to build, it's easy to see that the modern American nuclear industry is literally multiple orders of magnitude away from providing more than ancillary support to a broader green energy economy, powered primarily by solar and wind.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a universe where investment in nuclear energy deployment continued apace for the past few decades, laying the foundation for a zero-carbon nuclear future.

"It is just a formal notation. NO3^(-)-N means somehting like ""nitrogens in nitrate"". \n\nExample: you are testing a 10 L soil sample for nitrate. You get 1 mole of nitrate es result.

This is often used in enviormental chemistry, food chemistry and other related fields, because upper limits are often defined via a max nitrogen equivalent.

The brain is the most complex structure in the universe and so the consciousness is very likely to be an emergent property of the brain. \n\n\nOther support for the second school is that we can alter consciousness by altering the brain and/or its chemicals, suggesting that the brain is the basis for the mind. \n\n\nOf course, the first idea I presented is usually favoured by religious/spiritual people, and I'd suggest it's because they want to believe in something bigger than a materialist view of the universe, suggested by the the second idea. However, that's not disproof. The neurologist D. Hoffman believes in the first school of thought. I think his argument has some holes and he has sent me some counter arguments to read, but I haven't had time to do so yet. The great thing about him is that he wants to bring consciousness research into the realm of testable hypotheses and he believes his idea starts that.

You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.  Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules.

I recommend checking out these links for more information.\n\nAlso, take time to read about how addicting this drug can be and the negative effects that you can experience when coming off of it. \n\n""How does Adderall reduce social anxiety?\n\nAdderall is a psychostimulant that causes dopamine to be released into the brain. Additionally, it does release norepinephrine and can affect serotonin. This drug makes most people feel good, focused, and productive. It releases social anxiety by stimulating the brain so that during social situations, you don’t have difficulty thinking of what to say; it makes you feel calm and focused at the optimal dose.""\n\nhttps://mentalhealthdaily.com/2013/03/03/adderall-for-anxiety-disorders-a-counterintuitive-treatment-option/\n\nhttps://www.mdlinx.com/article/methylphenidate-improved-both-social-anxiety-and-adhd-symptoms-in-adults-study-found/lfc-1260\n\nhttps://www.theraleighhouse.com/addiction-blog/adderall-and-social-anxiety\n\nhttps://www.addictioncenter.com/stimulants/adderall/",Biology

"Simply put, inertia is the tendency of an object to keep doing what it's doing. Newton's first law of motion is also called the law of inertia commonly said as ""an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside unbalanced force."" In classical mechanics, gravity is just another force so if the gravitational force isn't balanced out by some other force then the object will accelerate according to Newton's second law.\n\nYou can also think of inertia as related to mass. It is harder to slow down a train moving at 50 m/s than it is to slow down a ball of paper moving at 50 m/s. And an object moving 1000 km/s in deep space (i.e. away from the influence of other objects' gravity) will continue to move 1000 km/s in the same direction until something changes that. \n\nPhysicists sometimes distinguish between inertial mass and gravitational mass though experimentally they've always been measured to be the same thing. In this case, inertial mass is the mass you see in Newton's second law when written as F=ma and gravitational mass creating the gravitational potential in the equation U = -Gm/r. Inertial mass would relate a force on an object to its overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines how much gravity an object has. Though again as far as we can tell they're the same.\n\nInertia also increases without bound as you push an object closer and closer to the speed of light. In other words, it gets harder and harder to speed up an object as you push it closer and closer to the speed of light.\n\nA final note on inertia there's also rotational inertia, which is the rotational analog of mass. Something with a higher moment of inertia is both harder to start spinning and harder to stop spinning. Moment of inertia (the official name for rotational inertia) depends not only on the mass of the object but also the distribution of mass away from the axis of rotation. A simple demonstration to see this is to take a meterstick and twirl it around its center vs trying to twirl it with the same force about one end. It's a lot harder to sping around one end because the mass is on average further away from the axis of rotation.",Physics

"Well based on experience, the bike never tilts to the left (literally never so long as the bicycle is moving forwards, it literally feels like a constant pull on my bike towards the right into the ground) so that’s counterintuitive about the weight. Thus, I cannot lean to the right because the bike is already tilting right the moment i lift my hands off. Ive been cycling long enuf without hands to be able to feel the bike tilting and i have to lean left if the weight was on the left. I know its weird but it is the actual observation so there must be someway to explain it. And just fyi the weight was probably around 500grams, it was a food takeaway box, and it wouldn’t shift my center of gravity by much at all wouldn’t it?

"Start simple. \n\nModelling things like this usually involves calculating the result numerically because the analytic results can get out of hand quickly. \n\nThe simplest numerical method is finite difference on a regular grid - you're essentially sampling the field at the grid points. Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.",Physics

"One should keep in mind that most dark matter ""alternatives"", including this one, actually include dark matter.

In (2) we have a new d.o.f. φ [...] What should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of ϕ be? The MOND law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter. There is, however, another empirical law which concerns cosmology: the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a^(−3).\n\nIn other words, they are saying that to get the cosmology right, they need to add dark matter -- that is what they are alluding to with the ""sizable amounts of energy"". They make their φ field play this role. It's just like TeVeS, the other major relativistic MOND theory, where the scalar ""S"" field does the same thing.\n\nThe popular press likes to frame the debate as ""dark matter vs. modified gravity"", but it's really ""dark matter vs. dark matter plus modified gravity"". The hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better, at the cost of higher theoretical complexity. If you read the paper, the authors aren’t trying to do away with dark matter at all — their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstacles.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also feel like I should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is ""less elegant"" than dark matter. These days, dark matter models are not about elegance at all, they're about minimality: trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles, with the simplest possible interactions, focusing on the dumbest possible first guess. There was an era where people to make dark matter ""elegantly"" fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the Standard Model at once, but that ship has sailed because those theories didn't work.

This *usually* does not produce a well-rounded, coherent theory with a multitude of new predictions that fits neatly into all observed models (for a converse example, see general relativity, which did this perfectly). \n\nA solution to the horizon problem which I *wouldn't* consider ""hack-ish"" is one that has some kind of underlying conceptual impetus for *why* another ad-hoc scalar quantum field is a sensible addition to our universal framework, akin to *why* space-time is a sensible view of the universe.

The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being 1-sn the carbon at the top and 3-sn the one at the bottom.\n\nThe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration (D or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.\n\nFor example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.\n\nMost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or 3-sn position.[5] Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2-sn, with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or sn3 position.[5]",Chemistry

While I was in college, I didn't do any research and didn't form relationships with professors (which, in hindsight, was obviously pretty dumb). My grades were good, at least.\n\nSince graduating, I've been working in a lab in (I guess?) industry, doing mostly formulations-related stuff (largely in a box) as well as a couple of other projects in general. Although the work that I do on a daily basis is literally ""chemistry"" and literally ""research"", a lot of it is grunt work. I do feel decently confident in the lab, though, and feel like I've accumulated general lab / chemistry skills here and there.\n\nThe pay is solid and I enjoy people at my company in general, but the job itself is unsatisfying. The pandemic has kind of encouraged me not to quit, at least in the short term.\n\nAnyway, would attempting to get into a master's program in chemistry be a good idea? Bad idea? Am I misunderstanding the concept of a master's altogether? Ignoring that I will again have to very awkwardly beg professors for the third professor-written letter of rec (who probably remembered me 4 years ago when I was first getting a job and asking but may not now), does the lack of specifically academic research hurt? Does the fact that chemistry was my minor and not my major hurt?

"In this visualization, I show the wavefront propagation of a coherent light beam (i.e., a simple laser) after passing through a holographic film, on where I previously recorded the relative information corresponding to the phase and amplitude of the object to be reproduced.\n\nPrecisely, the recorded film needs to reproduce the Fourier transform of the object up to an arbitrary phase factor.\n\nAn experimental technique for recording the hologram is interferometry; that is, a second wavefront, mutually coherent with the first and of known amplitude and phase, is added to the wavefront produced by illuminating the object we want to reconstruct. The holograms can also be entirely generated by a computer, like the ones shown here.\n\nThe standard recording material for the holographic film is a silver halide emulsion. Spatial light modulators, which are based on a LCD, can be used for creating real-time varying holograms.

"I think we've converged on most points.\n\nFor the last one, neutrinos have mass. This is well established at many many sigma. There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",Physics

"Pressure building up in the bottle as the air inside it warms up. This is a fundamental behaviour of all materials. It’s especially pronounced in gasses and fluids since their molecules aren’t stuck together like solids.\n\nWe can express this as the ideal gas law\n\n(Pressure) x (Volume of container) = (amount of gas) x (Conversion ratio) x (Temperature). \n\nSince the amount of air isn’t changing, and the volume of container isn’t either, change to temperature has a directly proportional effect on the pressure of the bottle.\n\nEventually the pressure overcomes the weight of the lid, and latch.\n\nIt then equalizes pressure, gas leaves the system, and the lid falls, closing.\n\nActually similar to how the coolant in your car engine gets distributed. There is a flow regulator they call a thermostat that as it gets warmer it expands and lets through more coolant starting at some designated temp. If it gets cool it provides less coolant. It’s a self regulating system, and how your car engine always stays at the same temp once it’s heated up.",Physics

"My knowledge of the nutrition literature is very sketchy further back than the year 2000.\n\nThe 9 essential amino acids were known by the 1940s. Its the same 9 essential amino acids for humans, cows, chickens, and *all* animals. No animal is an essential amino acid producer, they're all ""middlemen"". In evolution, creatures that evolved to eat plants or other animals lost the same set of metabolic pathways early, over 1000 million years ago.\n\nNutritional requirements for protein have become better defined with time. I'd recommend the WHO's [Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Human Nutrition](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf;jsessionid=42513E10FE32E690D087BCDF2725806C?sequence=1), from 2007, for the still current consensus.\n\nThe requirements are fairly fixed by lean body mass, and its still common for some elderly to fall short, mostly because they're sedentary and eat so few calories in total that the dietary proportions that served them in youth no longer provide enough protein to support immune function. There's no requirement for the elderly to consume animal products, but for those who consume fewer calories in total, the requirement for protein may rise from the \~10% of calories required in younger people to 15-20% of calories. The additional protein could come from eggs & cheese, or from legumes and tofu.\n\nThere was an [interesting paper from 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311400062X) which found mild protein restriction was associated with protection against chronic disease and mortality, but only up to age 65 to 70. After that, higher protein intake in the 10-20% range improved survival. I think in this study we're seeing both some benefit from mild protein restriction in preventing cardiovascular and metabolic disease in middle age, and also a benefit of ensuring enough protein for our immune cells to proliferate in response to infection, in the elderly.\n\nI eat a plant based diet for health, and became fascinated with the nutrition and health literature about a decade ago. Because plant based diets can be unbalanced, I was concerned about the essential amino acids likely to be deficient. The key requirement for  is 30 mg/kg/day of lysine, and 15 mg/kg/day for methionine + cysteine (from table 49 of the WHO document cited above). Meet those, and its pretty much assured the other essential amino acids will be adequate. In practice, it generally means most plant based eaters need 2-3 servings of legumes daily, to ensure adequate lysine.

"A small part of it has to do with gyroscopic procession, which takes a lot of explanation to understand, but the main force behind a football's stability is that it rotates around its axis of minumum inertia. \n\nTake your phone, and spin it in the air around its long axis. This is the exact same physical state as the football. The mass of the ball is distributed closest to the axis, so it is least likely to deviate from a spin.\n\nIf any force were to cause it to wobble, it would want to return to its its smallest moment of inertia at first, and this would be guarded by gyroscopic procession, which causes all movement parallel to the axis of rotation to occur processed 90 degrees forward along the direction of rotation. Any outside force, instead of spinning the ball, would just cause it to wobble.\n\nI hope this helps.",Physics

"Could you elaborate more on your second law of thermodynamics claim? And also more broadly why you think the energy required to capture carbon must be greater than or equal to the energy we gained from it initially. After looking more into it, I’m a little more skeptical. \n\nYou can see here (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=73&t=11) that different sources produce different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same amount of energy produced. When climeworks or anyone else captures CO2, there will be a fixed energy cost. It won’t vary based on whether the CO2 being captured came from burning coal or natural gas or from some natural process. All of these will generate CO2 with different amounts of energy produced. Like I said before, carbon capture isn’t trying to reverse the initial carbon emission process. The CO2 ends up bound in a different molecule or solid than it initially was before it was emitted. In fact, when gas phase CO2 binds to a typical adsorbent, it is energetically favored for the CO2 to be bound, so that energy will be released in the form of heat. This heating up of the material upon CO2 adsorption is actually problematic sometimes since the heat has to be dissipated for more CO2 to bind, depending on the way CO2 binds to the material. \n\nIn this type of adsorbing set up, the main energy cost is associated with desorption of the CO2. The energy inputted to desorb the CO2 is completely independent of the energy gained when the coal or oil was burned. The energy needed to desorb the bound CO2 depends only on the specifics of the adsorbing materials, and we are capable of generating materials with a large range of adsorption enthalpies.",Physics

"Industrial medicinal chemistry here, not in the US but there'll be some commonalities.\n\nYou'd start doing synthetic organic chemistry while they teach you the med chem, the chemistry is often simpler and less cutting edge than what you're probably doing for your PhD but the priority is getting the compound out for testing as fast as possible. There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data. For me, getting the data back on something you designed or made and seeing it progress through the assays is a really fun part of the job.\n\nEquipment and time-saving kit are more readily available. Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it. Industry loves new technology and will often invest in it quite heavily. More time is spent on admin and meetings than in academia, and there are far more rules and policies to follow.\n\nSalary is usually pretty good and should be much better than a PhD stipend, most companies have bonuses and stock options too.

It’s kind of like I feel an invisible force pulling me to the right\n\nEven more interestingly, i could tilt my body left first, while still holding the handlebar to balance, then lift my hands off and the bicycle will continue to cycle straight perfectly balanced. If i start off perfectly balanced and lift my hands off then the bicycle will start tilting to the right which after a set amount of tilt, I will start responding and leaning my body to the left to counter the tilt\n\nConsider this similar observation I made as well, when cycling without hands, if strong wind comes at me at 90 degrees from my right to left, my bike starts tilting right against the wind.

"Well if you are getting 1000 ppm O2 within a minute, you either have a fairly big leak or your O2 sensor has gone bad. Or both. The classic test for the sensor is to open up some diethylzinc in the box and see if it smokes (indicating O2 > \~10 ppm). I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire). You could maybe do a ketyl test if you have the reagents. If you have a spare O2 sensor, I would go ahead and replace the current one and see what happens.\n\nA few questions: did you turn off the gas circulation before opening the MeI, and did you purge thoroughly after it was re-sealed? MeI is going to absolutely wreck the box catalyst if you are not careful. The O2 sensor may also be sensitive to MeI - those sensors typically have a lifetime of 6 months - 2 years, but they have somewhat sensitive surfaces that can be poisoned by exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nFinal question: is the H2O also shooting up, or is it just the O2? If it is both, that points to a leak, but if it is just O2, I would suspect the sensor.",Chemistry

Very low yield. Also tried tosylating and similar outcome. Did a reaction with PBr3 and got the primary alcohol selectively transformed but low yield and not sure if I'll have difficulty adding the amine there in the presence of a phenol. One of the major byproducts I've gotten when attempting to add amine is the elimination product to get a monosubstituted alkene so I've tried using different bases to deprotonate the DEA but doesn't seem to be helping.

Applying a specific voltage to each pixel you can vary the value of the circular birefringence of the medium and locally modify the phase and intensity of the output wavefront.",Physics

Cold neutrons travel around 2200 m/s, or roughly 7e-6 c (c is the speed of light). Ultracold neutrons are much slower, so we can approximate them as stationary.\n\nAt 7e-6 c time dilation is a 2.5e-11 effect, which is **much** smaller than the 1e-2 effect that we are trying to understand.

"Thallium possesses several closed shells of d and f-electrons, but once they are completely filled they tend to become irrelevant. (hence the comparison of distance to xenon and radon is a bit inaccurate) A very important aspect is the inert pair effect of s-electrons. It simply states that as you go to higher rows, e. g within the 3rd main group from boron to aluminium to gallium to indium and finally to thallium, the s-electrons become increasingly more difficult to access. The effect originates from quantum mechanics. This means in essence that the tendency of being most stable in the +I compared to the +III state increases with increasing mass of the element. In other words, removing both s-electrons from the valence shell of thallium is more difficult than for indium, gallium, aluminium or boron. (The same trend applies also to the 4th and somewhat to the 5th main group) Negative oxidation states are for  elements of the 3rd main group exceedingly rare, because their electromegativities are relatively low. This means that the valence shell of thallium for example is barely capable of accommodating one additional electron. negatively charged thallium ions are therefore rarely formed. It may be possible that stuff like CsTl exists, but I would not bet on it.",Chemistry

"Yeah, that’s what I was mainly talking about too. Did you read my post past the first example? It applies about the same for flue streams as it does to atmospheric CO2, which is why I brought it up. The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. \n\n(If you just feel like skimming the rest of this, see the paragraphs I say are the most important one. It provides links to journal articles which directly address what thermodynamic processes are important in determining the limits of direct air capture. One passage from one of the journal articles directly addresses and contradicts your claim.)\n\nDo you think that people who research carbon capture whether from coal/natural gas plants or from the atmosphere are just missing this very straightforward energy argument you’re making? Process chemistry analysis of the feasibility of carbon capture is done on all of these different capture environments. Have these people missed out on the apparent massive flaw in direct air capture? If you read such a paper, it even talks about energy requirements and related concerns for carbon capture. A conclusion you won’t find in this analysis is that “carbon capture is pointless because the energy required to capture the carbon is too high.” You can read this article (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2020.00092/full). Note the following quotation “Based on these studies, DAC is currently considered as an energy-intensive and costly approach for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, researchers believe that the high cost and energy consumption in such systems are mostly due to the immaturity of the technology, and hence DAC may be eventually considered as a viable option for removing CO2 from the atmosphere.” There’s no suggestion that DAC is futile because of thermodynamics restrictions. Perhaps you have a reservation about this journal (I know it’s maybe a little controversial - my main experience with it has been with a very high quality review article I read in it on a different topic though), in which case I’m sure you can find other articles on this topic in other journals, although the corresponding author’s google scholar looks legitimate enough. \n\n(These next 2 paragraphs are the most important part of my reply)\n\nYou can also check out (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00173) which is a very well cited review on direct air capture. They even have a thermodynamics section toward the end. Note that they even mention the second law of thermodynamics, but the process they are applying it to is CO2 binding to the adsorbent and then having it unbind. Citation 28 of that paper directly addresses a theoretical lower bound for the energy requirements in section 2.1. Here’s a link for a pdf of it. (https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00003926/document) The paragraphs at the start of section 2 explain how the relevant thermodynamic process doesn’t involve whatever it was that initially put the CO2 there, but rather have to do with adsorption and desorption from the material. Note how they don’t even mention the source of the CO2 in the atmosphere. \n\nThat article in citation 28 even has this quotation “The ∼4 GJ/tC minimum may be compared to the carbon-specific energy content of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas have about 40, 50, and 70 GJ/tC respectively. Thus if the energy for air capture is provided by fossil fuels then the amount of carbon captured from the air can—in principle—be much larger than the carbon content of the fuel used to capture it. The fuel carbon can, of course, be captured as part of the process rather than being emitted to the air.” This directly shows that your claim is incorrect. \n\nI’m not trying to be argumentative for its own sake; your claim sounded intuitive enough that I figured people might read it, think it sounded right, and then move on with a very misinformed opinion on direct air capture. In another thread on this subreddit I even saw a similar claim to the one you made being made, so it seems like others find this type of argument compelling, but I’m not sure where it’s coming from. \n\nRegarding your other point, I don’t understand why the main thing you responded to had to do with the greenhouse effect either. Obviously CO2 is a greenhouse gas. My point was that the CO2 that gets captured may or may not be in an excited vibrational state when it gets captured. Ultimately, it doesn’t even matter for the rest of the argument though. The 2 main paragraphs above show that your thermodynamic argument is incorrect with peer-reviewed journal articles.",Physics

"The unit cell for bismuth is rhombohedral, but that doesn't actually tell you very much about the macroscopic crystal. To grow a large bismuth hopper like this, you want to hit a sweet spot of crystallization speed so that your crystal is hefty but still has that distinctive growth pattern. In my experience, the trick is to have a big crucible of molten bismuth just above the melting point, and to use a seed crystal to dredge a big chunk of bismuth from the center of the melt before the entire thing has a chance to freeze solid.\n\nFun fact about bulk bismuth: it is one of few materials for which the solid phase is less dense than the liquid (like water).",Chemistry

"Hey man, not sure why people are up in arms if this is truly not for a grade, which I hope it is not. OH proton signals are typically funky and broad because they exchange with solvent (they are somewhat acidic), so that statement is telling you the singlet belongs to the OH proton. The small signal at 78 ppm in the C NMR is from solvent if it was run in a chlorinated solvent, otherwise it may be from your analyte (what would make a C appear at higher ppm?) So now you can use the MW along with the fact you have a Cl and O to play around with some structures which match your H and C NMR.\n\nEdit: I'm certain the small peak in the C NMR is solvent, so ignore it. You should have been told the solvent it was run in. CDCl3 shows up around 77 ppm on C NMR.",Chemistry

"I can attest from personal experience it is impossible to ride with more than a small amount of weight. I'm sure many a child has figured out the hard way that letting go of the handlebars while an external force is acting on them (such as wind, a bag of groceries, or a dog leash) is an extremely bad idea. The precise effect depends on the bicycle geometry - the fork angle, wheel offset, handlebar width, handle bar offset from the axis of steering, the rider's weight and position. For example shorter handlebar offsets causes lateral loads to contribute more to leaning the bike, whereas longer offsets causes the load to produce more steer and offset the weight from the steering axis considerably. The tire's trail affects how the bike handles at a given steer and lean angle. Most of the time though, the slackened steering produces a reversed castor wheel effect, a bag of groceries on one side will mostly tend to just steer very severely that direction in an attempt to reach the local minima of the slanted steering axis. Depending on the exact geometry, skill, weight, etc it's possible to just no-hands around in a circle with a weight on one bar, where the steering force is counteracted by the centripetal normal force, as that weight is directly analogous to a rider applying the same load with their hands to enter a turn, however this represents a singular self-stable state. If the bag is swinging around dramatically from the unsteadiness it would produce, you now have this crazy double-pendulum chaotic system. The question gets more interesting when you add a dog leash to the equation, as the force can now act along angles that the bike was not designed to self-stabilize against. The leash can be pulling out of a turn while the bike is attempting to steer into it which can cause sudden inversions in the force vectors along an unexpected axis, leading to undesireable behavior such as the wheel suddenly being oversteered, or the bike leaning out of a turn while steering into it. One can easily experiment with this unusual dynamic system with just two bikes - by riding one and pushing another beside yourself by the handlebars, you can feel how changing the position of your hand on the bar changes how the driving, slowing, banking, and steering forces all get mixed up.",Physics

"Everything is a carcinogen. Our own body produces carcinogens by creating ATP. It’s a question of exposing your body to something that damages your DNA faster than your body can make repairs. There are some things, like asbestos, where even just one fiber can cause cancer, but most things, it’s how much you’re exposed to. Peanut butter, for instance, is a carcinogen but 40 tablespoons of peanut butter has the same cancer risk as a single cigarette. And it’s all risk, there isn’t a guarantee that anything will for sure cause cancer. But a single drop of nail polish on your bedsheet is really not enough of a cancer risk to even blink at. But something else that’s important is that being stressed a lot is a bigger health issue than spilling nail polish. If you are worried that you will damage your relationship with your family by telling them you spilled a little nail polish- you need a professional therapist to help you with your anxiety.

"Why would this be a process you attempt in situ? You're telling me you'll design an entirely new nuclear reactor based entirely on the idea that it might maybe form something somewhat beneficial? I mean, you're talking about introducing a fuel rod, a reflector and a gas  into a reactor. Just with fuel rod and reflector, you would at a minimum need to completely overhaul a reactor to swap it out to your newly designed fuel rod and reflector. Plus you'd need to introduce a gas stream into the system which gets very complicated. Cooling efficiency would change dramatically... so... I really don't see any other option than complete redesign. I'm also not sure what you're doing about cladding. Every fuel rod I know of is encased in a cladding material that would prevent the formation of the uranium nitride you want since that uranium is not exposed to the NH3. I'm willing to bet that a basic solution is not ideal for the system, either. \n\nI don't know the decay chains of everything so I'll just take your word that a neutron will create 15-N. Presumably that will be most efficient at a certain neutron velocity so why wouldn't you take a nitrogen source to something like a spallation neutron source or just another reactor (there's a few designed as neutron sources) where you can convert it to 15-N with significantly higher efficiency? Plus then you're designing a reactor around a known advancement rather than around something that might maybe create that advancement.",Chemistry
