      "Ill attempt to answer your question in the most straight forward and simplistic way I can  Ill avoid getting too detailed so you can wrap your mind around the basic concept of viruses \\n\\n\\n\\nViruses dont want anything or have goals motives desires or intent Viruses exist to only to replicate \\n\\nViruses are completely reliant on a host to do the replication for them \\n\\nVirulence is a human created term to categorize the severity of illness caused by a viral infection \\n\\nSome viruses cause little if any ill effect on the host\\n\\nSome viruses cause the host to fall ill for prolonged periods of time \\n\\nSome viruses can infect a host for the duration of the hosts life \\n\\nSome viruses can cause severe acute illness followed by death \\n\\nSome viruses infect a host just once but leave the host forever scarred or with significant longterm health issues \\n\\nMany viruses are host specific meaning they can only infect a certain species  \\n\\nViruses infect very specific cellular systems within the host species  \\n\\nThoes infected cells are hijacked by the viral genetic information and given instruction to replicate the virus over and over and over again until the infected cell bursts with millions of copies of the virus  \\n\\nThe replicated viral copies quickly infect the adjoining cells and the process repeats until either all the cells are destroyed or the immune system of the host gets the viral invasion under control \\n\\nMutations during the replication process drive the evolution and success of viruses \\n\\nThe more the virus is able to replicate the higher the probability of a mutation occurring \\n\\nMutation are caused by errors made in the replication process  Nearly all mutations are unsuccessful deadends for the virus \\n\\nSome chance random mutations may make the virus more successful \\n\\nA beneficial mutation may give a virus ability to replicate at a greater rate in greater numbers infect different cellular systems or even infect other species\\n\\nWhen a virus mutates to infect a new  species it becomes a novel virus for the new hosts \\n\\nA novel virus can be highly virulent on a new host because the new host has no immunity to combat the virus \\n\\nA novel virus can replicate unchecked within the new host specie because there is no programed immune response to combat the novel viral infection  \\n\\nWhen a virus is given the opportunity to replicate unimpeded the probability of a successful mutations increases \\n\\nAs the virus mutates through host replication it may become more virulent on the host \\n\\nIf a virus is overly virulent on its host it often leads to an evolutionary dead end  in other words if all the hosts are killed by a virus the virus wont be able to replicate and will go extinct\\n\\nOver time natural selection tends to favor the mutations that make virus more transmissible over mutations that make it more virulent \\n\\nThe most successful viruses are ones that have evolved to be highly transmissible but have minimal virulent effects on the host \\n\\nSome viruses can be highly virulent on certain individuals in the host population and have no virulent impact on other individuals within the same population \\n\\nOver time the genetic traits in thoes unaffected individuals will be passed along to subsequent generations and become the dominant trait within the host population  \\n\\nThis relationship between viruses and their hosts has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years Its known as an evolutionary arms race \\n\\nViruses have always and will continue to always be one of the selection factors driving the evolution and diversity of species on our planet  \\n\\n\\n\\nAgain I tried to make the information very simple and loose  I left our a tremendous amount of information in hopes to provide some insight without confusion\n",
      "When the ball rebounds away from you the magnitude of the impulse change in momentum is the same for you and the ball but in opposite directions\\nImpulse is proportional to the mass and the change in velocity which means the change in velocity is inversely proportional to the mass\\nYou have more mass than the ball no offence so your change in velocity is smaller than the balls\\nNow the rebound happens over the same timeframe for both you and the ball it is the duration of time where the ball is in contact with you during the rebound\\nAcceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time it took to change\\nTherefore the acceleration is higher for the ball than it is for you because the change in velocity is higher and it happens across the same timeframe\\n\\nI hope that helps Someone could probably explain it better\n",

      "Simply put inertia is the tendency of an object to keep doing what its doing Newtons first law of motion is also called the law of inertia commonly said as an object in motion stays in motion and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside unbalanced force In classical mechanics gravity is just another force so if the gravitational force isnt balanced out by some other force then the object will accelerate according to Newtons second law\\n\\nYou can also think of inertia as related to mass It is harder to slow down a train moving at 50 ms than it is to slow down a ball of paper moving at 50 ms And an object moving 1000 kms in deep space ie away from the influence of other objects gravity will continue to move 1000 kms in the same direction until something changes that \\n\\nPhysicists sometimes distinguish between inertial mass and gravitational mass though experimentally theyve always been measured to be the same thing In this case inertial mass is the mass you see in Newtons second law when written as F=ma and gravitational mass creating the gravitational potential in the equation U = Gmr Inertial mass would relate a force on an object to its overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines how much gravity an object has Though again as far as we can tell theyre the same\\n\\nInertia also increases without bound as you push an object closer and closer to the speed of light In other words it gets harder and harder to speed up an object as you push it closer and closer to the speed of light\\n\\nA final note on inertia theres also rotational inertia which is the rotational analog of mass Something with a higher moment of inertia is both harder to start spinning and harder to stop spinning Moment of inertia the official name for rotational inertia depends not only on the mass of the object but also the distribution of mass away from the axis of rotation A simple demonstration to see this is to take a meterstick and twirl it around its center vs trying to twirl it with the same force about one end Its a lot harder to sping around one end because the mass is on average further away from the axis of rotation\n",

      "Could you elaborate more on your second law of thermodynamics claim And also more broadly why you think the energy required to capture carbon must be greater than or equal to the energy we gained from it initially After looking more into it I’m a little more skeptical \\n\\nYou can see here httpswwweiagovtoolsfaqsfaqphpid=73t=11 that different sources produce different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same amount of energy produced When climeworks or anyone else captures CO2 there will be a fixed energy cost It won’t vary based on whether the CO2 being captured came from burning coal or natural gas or from some natural process All of these will generate CO2 with different amounts of energy produced Like I said before carbon capture isn’t trying to reverse the initial carbon emission process The CO2 ends up bound in a different molecule or solid than it initially was before it was emitted In fact when gas phase CO2 binds to a typical adsorbent it is energetically favored for the CO2 to be bound so that energy will be released in the form of heat This heating up of the material upon CO2 adsorption is actually problematic sometimes since the heat has to be dissipated for more CO2 to bind depending on the way CO2 binds to the material \\n\\nIn this type of adsorbing set up the main energy cost is associated with desorption of the CO2 The energy inputted to desorb the CO2 is completely independent of the energy gained when the coal or oil was burned The energy needed to desorb the bound CO2 depends only on the specifics of the adsorbing materials and we are capable of generating materials with a large range of adsorption enthalpies\n",

      "Yeah that’s what I was mainly talking about too Did you read my post past the first example It applies about the same for flue streams as it does to atmospheric CO2 which is why I brought it up The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all \\n\\nIf you just feel like skimming the rest of this see the paragraphs I say are the most important one It provides links to journal articles which directly address what thermodynamic processes are important in determining the limits of direct air capture One passage from one of the journal articles directly addresses and contradicts your claim\\n\\nDo you think that people who research carbon capture whether from coalnatural gas plants or from the atmosphere are just missing this very straightforward energy argument you’re making Process chemistry analysis of the feasibility of carbon capture is done on all of these different capture environments Have these people missed out on the apparent massive flaw in direct air capture If you read such a paper it even talks about energy requirements and related concerns for carbon capture A conclusion you won’t find in this analysis is that “carbon capture is pointless because the energy required to capture the carbon is too high” You can read this article httpswwwfrontiersinorgarticles103389fenrg202000092full Note the following quotation “Based on these studies DAC is currently considered as an energyintensive and costly approach for removing CO2 from the atmosphere However researchers believe that the high cost and energy consumption in such systems are mostly due to the immaturity of the technology and hence DAC may be eventually considered as a viable option for removing CO2 from the atmosphere” There’s no suggestion that DAC is futile because of thermodynamics restrictions Perhaps you have a reservation about this journal I know it’s maybe a little controversial  my main experience with it has been with a very high quality review article I read in it on a different topic though in which case I’m sure you can find other articles on this topic in other journals although the corresponding author’s google scholar looks legitimate enough \\n\\nThese next 2 paragraphs are the most important part of my reply\\n\\nYou can also check out httpsdoiorg101021acschemrev6b00173 which is a very well cited review on direct air capture They even have a thermodynamics section toward the end Note that they even mention the second law of thermodynamics but the process they are applying it to is CO2 binding to the adsorbent and then having it unbind Citation 28 of that paper directly addresses a theoretical lower bound for the energy requirements in section 21 Here’s a link for a pdf of it httpshalshsarchivesouvertesfrhalshs00003926document The paragraphs at the start of section 2 explain how the relevant thermodynamic process doesn’t involve whatever it was that initially put the CO2 there but rather have to do with adsorption and desorption from the material Note how they don’t even mention the source of the CO2 in the atmosphere \\n\\nThat article in citation 28 even has this quotation “The ∼4 GJtC minimum may be compared to the carbonspecific energy content of fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas have about 40 50 and 70 GJtC respectively Thus if the energy for air capture is provided by fossil fuels then the amount of carbon captured from the air can—in principle—be much larger than the carbon content of the fuel used to capture it The fuel carbon can of course be captured as part of the process rather than being emitted to the air” This directly shows that your claim is incorrect \\n\\nI’m not trying to be argumentative for its own sake your claim sounded intuitive enough that I figured people might read it think it sounded right and then move on with a very misinformed opinion on direct air capture In another thread on this subreddit I even saw a similar claim to the one you made being made so it seems like others find this type of argument compelling but I’m not sure where it’s coming from \\n\\nRegarding your other point I don’t understand why the main thing you responded to had to do with the greenhouse effect either Obviously CO2 is a greenhouse gas My point was that the CO2 that gets captured may or may not be in an excited vibrational state when it gets captured Ultimately it doesn’t even matter for the rest of the argument though The 2 main paragraphs above show that your thermodynamic argument is incorrect with peerreviewed journal articles\n",
      "The unit cell for bismuth is rhombohedral but that doesnt actually tell you very much about the macroscopic crystal To grow a large bismuth hopper like this you want to hit a sweet spot of crystallization speed so that your crystal is hefty but still has that distinctive growth pattern In my experience the trick is to have a big crucible of molten bismuth just above the melting point and to use a seed crystal to dredge a big chunk of bismuth from the center of the melt before the entire thing has a chance to freeze solid\\n\\nFun fact about bulk bismuth it is one of few materials for which the solid phase is less dense than the liquid like water\n",
      "A PhD is not the same kind of struggle as a BS program There is a completely different level of selfreliance and drive that is required to get through a research project where you are more or less completely responsible for the outcome Often there’s nothing that can you can look up or read that will give you the answer to your specific problem otherwise it wouldn’t be research 90 of the work you do may yield negative results and you have to be ok with coming into work everyday and “failing” despite your best efforts and as others have said even enjoy the process\\n\\nI would definitely recommend trying to get hired as an undergrad researcher in one of the groups in your department It’s really the only way to know for sure if you would enjoy that kind of work It can be incredibly rewarding if you are ok with the grind\n",
      "Hey man not sure why people are up in arms if this is truly not for a grade which I hope it is not OH proton signals are typically funky and broad because they exchange with solvent they are somewhat acidic so that statement is telling you the singlet belongs to the OH proton The small signal at 78 ppm in the C NMR is from solvent if it was run in a chlorinated solvent otherwise it may be from your analyte what would make a C appear at higher ppm So now you can use the MW along with the fact you have a Cl and O to play around with some structures which match your H and C NMR\\n\\nEdit Im certain the small peak in the C NMR is solvent so ignore it You should have been told the solvent it was run in CDCl3 shows up around 77 ppm on C NMR\n",
      "I can attest from personal experience it is impossible to ride with more than a small amount of weight Im sure many a child has figured out the hard way that letting go of the handlebars while an external force is acting on them such as wind a bag of groceries or a dog leash is an extremely bad idea The precise effect depends on the bicycle geometry  the fork angle wheel offset handlebar width handle bar offset from the axis of steering the riders weight and position For example shorter handlebar offsets causes lateral loads to contribute more to leaning the bike whereas longer offsets causes the load to produce more steer and offset the weight from the steering axis considerably The tires trail affects how the bike handles at a given steer and lean angle Most of the time though the slackened steering produces a reversed castor wheel effect a bag of groceries on one side will mostly tend to just steer very severely that direction in an attempt to reach the local minima of the slanted steering axis Depending on the exact geometry skill weight etc its possible to just nohands around in a circle with a weight on one bar where the steering force is counteracted by the centripetal normal force as that weight is directly analogous to a rider applying the same load with their hands to enter a turn however this represents a singular selfstable state If the bag is swinging around dramatically from the unsteadiness it would produce you now have this crazy doublependulum chaotic system The question gets more interesting when you add a dog leash to the equation as the force can now act along angles that the bike was not designed to selfstabilize against The leash can be pulling out of a turn while the bike is attempting to steer into it which can cause sudden inversions in the force vectors along an unexpected axis leading to undesireable behavior such as the wheel suddenly being oversteered or the bike leaning out of a turn while steering into it One can easily experiment with this unusual dynamic system with just two bikes  by riding one and pushing another beside yourself by the handlebars you can feel how changing the position of your hand on the bar changes how the driving slowing banking and steering forces all get mixed up\n",

      "Why would this be a process you attempt in situ Youre telling me youll design an entirely new nuclear reactor based entirely on the idea that it might maybe form something somewhat beneficial I mean youre talking about introducing a fuel rod a reflector and a gas  into a reactor Just with fuel rod and reflector you would at a minimum need to completely overhaul a reactor to swap it out to your newly designed fuel rod and reflector Plus youd need to introduce a gas stream into the system which gets very complicated Cooling efficiency would change dramatically so I really dont see any other option than complete redesign Im also not sure what youre doing about cladding Every fuel rod I know of is encased in a cladding material that would prevent the formation of the uranium nitride you want since that uranium is not exposed to the NH3 Im willing to bet that a basic solution is not ideal for the system either \\n\\nI dont know the decay chains of everything so Ill just take your word that a neutron will create 15N Presumably that will be most efficient at a certain neutron velocity so why wouldnt you take a nitrogen source to something like a spallation neutron source or just another reactor theres a few designed as neutron sources where you can convert it to 15N with significantly higher efficiency Plus then youre designing a reactor around a known advancement rather than around something that might maybe create that advancement\n",
