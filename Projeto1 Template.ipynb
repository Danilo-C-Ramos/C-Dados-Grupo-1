      "thank  if i assumed was an electric heater what would formula be\\n\\nyou correct though this sealed propane fireplace 50000btu burner looses 32 it’s efficiency due chimney\\n\\nalso reason question i have ‘new’ fireplace installed higher btu than old yet yields no  heat manufacture installer distributer all were over today filling air technogarbo why i should expect 50000 btu fireplace not heat room very well\\n\\ni did math 50000x68=34000 btu actual heat now demonstrate lack heat i converted this watts then showed 1500watt electric heater was hotter than fireplace \\n\\nwhat i would like show theoretical heat transfer temperature gain\\n\\nthanks agin time\n",

      "honestly i knew this wouldnt true but main reason i asked was see what people better understanding would say counteract give me better understanding why its not what makes different other forces this much better structured answer than last guy haha shows your intelligence understanding field isnt just your own ego\\n\\nand yes theres definitely lot out there but main theory i know bulk expands across universe some kinda 4th5th dimension its universal scale reason gravitys weakness thats one things theyre trying uncover lhc but idk on surface without deeper understanding seems pretty far fetched really makes me want delve deeper into try wrap my head around it\n",

      "well pardon me still not understanding because im real basic cyclist high school physics person but i have noticed my observation there seems nothing related counterbalancing shift center gravity remember weight always on left handlebar see your answer starts off me tilting right correct center gravity but very instant i lift my hands off handlebars from well balanced moving bicycle i can feel bike start progressively tilt right it’s kind like i feel an invisible force pulling me right\\n\\neven more interestingly i could tilt my body left first while still holding handlebar balance then lift my hands off bicycle will continue cycle straight perfectly balanced if i start off perfectly balanced lift my hands off then bicycle will start tilting right which after set amount tilt i will start responding leaning my body left counter tilt\\n\\nconsider this similar observation i made as well when cycling without hands if strong wind comes at me at 90 degrees from my right left my bike starts tilting right against wind these all too counterintuitive me understand what going on\n",
