"If you pile up electrons in a hypothetical chamber, they would occupy higher and higher energy levels because they repel each other and because they are fermions.\n\nThe first thing you would see is that nuclear reactions happen with the gas inside the chamber. The high density electrons would turn some of the protons into neutrons. You would see strange, stable isotopes that never occur in nature.\n\nIf you increase the electron density even further, you would start to see muons in the chamber. The electron energy levels are now so high that the system can gain energy by turning an electron into neutrinos and a muon in a low energy level.\n\nIf you go even higher, you fill up muon and electron energy levels. At some point, you have enough energy to create even tauons, which now pile up in the hypothetical chamber.\n\nThere's also the competing process that putting a lot of charge in one spot costs a lot of energy and a lot of energy in one spot can give you a black hole. It's not so easy to calculate when this would happen though with interacting fermions and all.",Physics

"Ok, I typed “natural immunity vs vaccine covid” into Google as you suggested.  The first result led me to [a CDC study published last month](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-1042_article) showing that in a cohort of 72 people they studied who tested positive, 36% of them did not develop antibodies at all (“serologic nonresponders”).\n\nThe second link is [another CDC study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_w) showing that in people who had been previously infected, adding vaccination on top of that makes you 2.34x less likely to get reinfected than not getting vaccinated and relying solely on infection-induced immunity.\n\nThe fourth link is [a not-yet-peer-reviewed preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1) suggesting that infection-induced immunity leads to a 13.06-fold lower risk of breakthrough infection is compared to only vaccine-induced immunity.\n\nSo yeah, I can Google, and Google disagrees with your point that anything has been “proven”.  There is evidence suggesting some various different things, and if you’re going to make claims, back it up with your evidence or someone will call you out on making false sweeping statements like that.\n\nNotice how I’m not saying the opposite has been proven?

"From my experience, high school chem is nothing like uni chem. Sure they teach you about bonds and elemental properties, but it's mostly oversimplified basics (which is harder to understand than if they explained in detail) and wet noodle you can live without.

"Here’s a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \n\n““>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. “\n\n[End of your quote. If you don’t feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there’s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I’ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don’t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I’ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I’m saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It’s one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you’re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I’ve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n“>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.”\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said “[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got” and then you tell me to “shut up” for saying that you said that “DAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.” I’m very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I’m this part where you quoted me I’m saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said “couldn’t be feasible” this was meant to be synonymous with “impossible” rather than “unfeasible,” then either you’ve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I’m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",Physics

"I don't feel there is any value to giving Hirsch anything. Perhaps it is technically required, but Hirsch is *not operating in good faith.* It does not *advance the cause of scientific truth*. A crank asking for the data is just useless noise and a distraction and, for that matter, so is this discussion.\n\nIf some rule forces scientists to deal with cranks without advancing the actual discovery of scientific truth, the rule is in this case not a positive one. The net contribution of Hirsch to the study of superconductivity is *negative.* A rule which allows him to badger any experimentalist in the field is a bad one.\n\nThis is independent of whether Dias completely made up his results or not: Hirsch is not going to provide any insight into that, and it's not possible for us to decide it either. It's going to be other actual experimentalists working with materials like this who will either succeed or fail to reproduce the behavior.\n\n> . I’d be much more convinced about CSH if they’d refute the issues he brought up instead of ignore them. They’ve been accused of the highest crime in academia, prove Hirsch wrong and sink him forever.\n\nThis is silly. It's not going to happen.

You can't just say the right magic words and stun Hirsch into silence with the power of data. \n\nAnd you can't ""sink him"": I think his reputation is probably as low as can be in the actual community of active researchers.

A good gravimeter will measure the local gravitational acceleration with a relative uncertainty below 10^(-10).\n\nNone of these give a good measurement for G because we don't know the mass of Earth precisely enough (our best estimate comes from using G to calculate the mass, so you can't do the reverse). To measure big G you need to measure the force between two (known) masses in the lab. The time dilation from that is far too small.",Physics

"I agree with most of what you said up there, though the effects of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere and the temperature of the planet were known as early as the second decade of the 20th century. And, yes, hydrocarbons have been awesome for rocketing humanity into the 21st century. But we aren't changing today. We know. We know what is happening to our planet, the science is solid and incontrovertible. And yet, our carbon production is growing every year. This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there. I wonder sometimes if articles like this aren't mostly posted by the paid corporate trolls of the carbon producing energy companies.

Very dependent on the enzyme but im gonna say not exactly.\n\nYou gotta understand theres a lot more than a single nano particle and that theres a lottttttt more than single strands of DNA in a nanoparticle. If you shine some radiation on a sample it wont homogenously effect each bit of DNA the same and many will go unscathed.\n\nAt that some modifications of DNA are going to be much more detrimental to DNA binding than others. Add in the fact that theres varying binding specificity and your enzyme you pick will matter. Some are super specific and wont bind if theres a change while others will bind to anything resembling DNA.\n\nTo have enough radiation to confidentally effect every bit of DNA in a nanoparticle youll also be messing up the tissue that its in. Proteins will also be messed up in the process for instance.\n\nIf the DNA containing lipid nanoparticles were separate from the tissue/enzyme to begin with and you treated it to a prolonged exposure to radiation before adding the nanoparticles to a culture/reaction  mix then sure tho,Biology

Wouldn't it alter the results?\n\nWe can measure them, but it doesn't alter the result. Beta decay is a stochastic event. How long a neutron has existed in the past does not effect the probability that a neutron decays in the future. A free neutron that has existed for an hour has the exact same probability to undergo decay as a free neutron that has existed for a second. However, most free neutrons will never make it to that one hour mark before decaying.",Physics

"I mean one of our biggest strengths as a species is the social nature of our brains. Not having as much of an incentive to interact probably wouldn’t result in modern humans.\n\nIf you’re speaking genetically then I think it wouldn’t work out. Normally, creatures that reproduce asexually are micro-organisms with relatively simple environmental factors and can also gain new genetic material through binary fission and the like. Any mutation made during dna replication would be permanent. Any damage would be passed on. This means as time went on the genome of the offspring would get worse and worse. It would be tantamount to inbreeding.",Biology

"So it's a laymen's term and my apologies,  but I try not to get too far into minute details on reddit threads out of fear it won't be fully understood by everyone reading it.\n\nWhen vaccinated, your immune system is ""boosted"" - hence the term ""boost"" or ""booster"" for the vaccine. You get a ""surge"", rapid increase, peak, whatever you want to call it to have it make sense to you (as a virologist, immunologist, entomologist, a new worried father, what have you), shortly after your immune system is stimulated. You would therefore after a vaccination ""booster"" get a ""surge"" or sudden increase in circulating antibodies. In this case for a booster it would be IgG antibodies over IgM, or even in this specific case of a pregnant/post-partum/breast-feeding mother IgA antibodies as it's present in her bodily fluids, but I digress.\n\nThen after a period of time the antibodies go down to almost undetectable levels. There's vast variations in the populations and within individuals, so saying that they go to ""0"" is not entirely accurate. In this day and age with there being no herd immunity, vaccine hesitation and resistance, etc., it's quite possible any particular person may have some level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulating at any point in time. That's why there's ""baseline"" with testing depending on the type of test done and what has been used as a control to establish that test. I've worked in a variety of laboratories and for instance, there's one influenza variant, let's call it variant A, that if your antibody titer is 1:8 or higher, you are considered immune to that virus (1 portion of your serum had enough antibodies present to bind to virus when mixed with blood and diluted at a ratio of 1:8). But let's also say there's another influenza variant, called B, that's a bit more funky, so we consider a titer of 1:16 or 1:32 protective. Or better yet, it's an H5-based influenza virus, in which case it's highly debated if HAI testing is even a good determinant of protective antibody response at all. But again, I digress.\n\nI hope this answered your question somewhat.",Biology

"Honestly there are a few other factors.  Most heat will be transferred through actual diffusion of air, not just conduction through window pane glass.  So if you have a lot of airflow, that will increase the rate of stabilizing the temperature (outside and inside being the same temperature). The only way that curtains will help is by blocking airflow to the window where conduction or diffusion (air escaping through tiny gaps) will happen.  But you could achieve a similar effect with something transparent (shower curtains honestly would be more than enough and prevent a decent amount of conduction).\n\nThe sun's radiated heat can be a huge factor in warming an area.

"First: There is a difference between ""natural occurring nuclides"" and ""primordial nuclides"". Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years. Which is still a lot more stable than their respective neighbors with half lives of some seconds. \nThe hunt is not over though! As I understood the island of stability isn't fully completed yet, so who knows.",Chemistry

Some animal species may consume herbivores and potentially increase the amount of primary producers within the ecosystem or these animals might help disperse the plants to previously unexploited locations that are conducive to primary producer productivity.",Biology

"The Tet repressor (Tet-R) binds a small DNA sequence (Tet-O) in the promoter of a gene and inhibits expression of the gene to which the promoter is attached.\n\nWith tetracycline (or doxicycline), Tet-R cannot bind the DNA sequence anymore, which means the repressor cannot repress anymore, which means the gene is expressed.\n\nThus if that gene is GFP or something else that you can easily detect, you can detect the presence of tetracycline, because the gene will activate only in the presence of tetracycline.\n\nIt really can only detect tetracyclines, so as a ""detector"" it's not super useful I'd say, but it's very practical to regulate the expression of a gene with it.",Biology
"According to general/special relativity we know that there is a universal speed limit- objects with mass require increasing amounts of energy to accelerate to higher velocities, and it would require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate any massive object to that speed limit which is obviously impossible.

As photons do not have mass, they must therefore travel at that universal speed limit in a vacuum. The universal speed limit isn't defined by the speed of light but the other way around.",Physics

"It looks like it is from the family Amaurobiidae. It appears to closely resemble the Callobius bennetti, or the Hacklemesh Spider, however, those are native to North America, and not the UK.

A spider can change/differ rather drastically from sling to juvenile to adult and from female to male. With each molt brings new changes, new surprises to behold.\nEye arrangements are best to classify family, and typically, leg details such as leg to body proportions, leg shape and placement, and toe count, along with spinneret, pedipalp (of the male), and ventral abdomen (of a female) characteristics help identify the particular species. These last two are usually used by experts, though, and not the general enthusiast, as you have to work fairly hard to get perfectly focused shots of a very minuscule subject at very iffy angles.\nHere is a link to those eye arrangements if you’d like to compare your little fella.\n\nhttps://bugguide.net/node/view/84423#Amaurobiidae\n\nThis following one matches rather closely, right down to the little white leg accents if you pay attention in photo, the legs on the far side of the body.

"Hello, I'm kinda stressing out about choosing to major in chemistry or some biological science.  \nA little background:  \nI am currently a sophomore in college. I entered as a computer science major. I have done really well so far, currently having a 3.97 GPA. Over this past year, my Grandfather entered hospice care. I have been taking care of him at night and in the mornings. I help him go to the bathroom and make sure he is clean. I give him baths and help administer medicine. I guess I'm trying to say I enjoy taking care of him. I feel drawn to the healthcare field now and I no longer really love computer science. I used to code for fun(make apps/build websites) but haven't felt the urge or desire to attempt any new projects. Looking out 5/10 years from now I don't really see myself being happy with software development even if there is a lot of money to be made. I think I want to become a doctor. I have always had a heart for taking care of people and I think becoming a doctor would be incredibly rewarding.  \nAnyways, I decided to take gen chem and biology as electives alongside my CS courses this semester to see if I could major in one of them. I am doing well in both of them right now with A's. I enjoy both courses but was wondering which one would be a better fit for me. Biology seems to involve a lot more memorization but also looks at how larger systems work. This is somewhat similar to CS problem solving in that it breaks complex systems into smaller ones that are more easily manageable. My chem course has more problem solving and math. I'm not the biggest fan of memorizing info even though I am pretty good at it. I enjoy math and breaking a problem down into more logical steps. I would rather work on 20 calculus problems for a couple of hours than review notecards for a couple of hours. I was wondering at the higher levels which major would suit my learning style better.  \n   \nIf anyone could help me out I would appreciate It. I apologize for any grammar/writing errors. I have never been too good at writing. Thanks again.",Chemistry

"There are 4 effects at play here.\n\nNote, most times mixing a strong base and vinegar most times achieves nothing other than making fizzy water.\n\nFirst: a process called ""salting out"".  Add a pinch of ordinary table salt to acrylic paints and it will destabilize, separate and you get a clear layer of water on top of thick sludge.  Analogy is you have a stable positive magnet floating and then you toss a whole bunch of negative magnets to make it crash.  Most polymers are stable only at certain controlled ionic balances.  Some stains work by sticking really tightly to the surface of a material, almost like a magnet or velcro.  Stain()+ <---> (-)fibre.   Blood, some paints, protein and a few others.  Adding a whole bunch of salt overwhelms any ionic interactions and disrupts the intermolecular interactions bonds so you end up with stain.Cl and fibre.Na.  The stain material just falls off.\n\nSecond: Vinegar that has been neutralized or in the acetate form is very good at ""chelating"" calcium compounds.  Your acrylic paint probably contains about 20% calcite (chalk) as a filler.  By using the acetate ion you remove the calcite, which loosens all the paint.\n\nThird: pH effects.  The acrylic latex usually contains a lot of acid functional groups from acrylic acid polymers.  When you add ammonia it can make the polymer soften.  Tough to explain the chemical theory, but acrylic polymers change hardness (glass transition) by a lot depending if they are at high or low pH (ionic or neutral acid form).  As the ammonia evaporates your solution pH will also drop.  By swapping pH you are doing the chemical equivalent of pushing it backwards and forwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForth: salt is a mild abrasive.  You effectively sand papered off the top layer of your clothing.  This is basis for the product Barkeepers Friend or Jiff.  Magic eraser would have the same effect.",Chemistry

Now, the further Electromagnetic waves travel, the higher the redshift is measured with an ""infinite redshift"" at the event horizon of our observable universe. \n\nDoes that mean the wavelength of those photons approach 0 and wouldn't that also mean, that energy density decreases with time and distance , leading to the curvature of spacetime to ""flatten"", but since energy is always conserved, wouldn't that also mean that space seemingly increases?

This means that they are fast growing animals with a very high mortality rate early in their lives(much like mackerels or sardines).",Biology

"...yeah, there's two things here that other people are either saying or dancing around:\n\n1.  There's an inherent conflict of interest and moral hazard about carbon capture tech:  if these companies want/need to remain profitable, they _need_ excess atmospheric carbon to exist, so that they have a product that _does_ something.  Also, since they have a product which captures carbon, people won't need to stop polluting.  This is just kicking the can down the road and allowing a literally extremely toxic system to continue existing.\n\n2.  There's an easier way out of this, but the solution is _political_, not technological.  It's really, really not hard to imagine a society where endless increasing production is not the _necessity_ to keep the 'economy' going.  This just requires completely retooling our political & economic system, since they are essentially the same thing at the moment.

The city I live in has three MPIs. I don’t work at one of those, but I do a PhD in physics in a similar institute. One of the other PhDs in my group did his master in the MPI on the other side of the road. He says working there was nice, but you need a proper work ethic (which you need anyway for a PhD). \nIn general, before starting a PhD you should find out who your direct supervisor is and who the professor you’re going to work under is. From my experience that’s often not the same person in the bigger institutes. So it’s good to make sure you can work with both of them.

"The same set of nine essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) are common to all animals, as far I know. In other words, sometime after a heterotrophic lifestyles developed in the pre-Cambrian, key enzymes in those metabolic pathways were lost, probably when our ancestors were single celled protists. Once those critters started eating other critters, there was no selection to conserve those chains of enzymes in the metabolic pathways.\n\nHumans can still synthesize the other proteinogenic amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, tyrosine) from other metabolic precursors, though perhaps not at levels ideal for human health. [Glycine](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/033/05/0771-0780) is of some interest here.\n\n\> Does the body know the difference\n\nYes. Some amino acids serve important signaling functions. For example, the most common essential amino acid, leucine, plays a key role in satiety and in telling individual cells whether they should adopt a anabolic (make stuff) or catabolic (recycle trash) tone. In both cases this is via the remarkable metabolic regulator [MTOR](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=mtor&as_occt=title) (mammalian target of rapamycin).\n\n\> Are these then stored or flushed through the lymphatic, on to elimination systems?\n\nNope.

"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesn’t matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. I’m more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someone’s substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. “Economic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air” (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what I’ve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. There’s nothing saying the second law efficiency can’t be better than 5%, and also it doesn’t matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency won’t be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation “Lackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.” In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology won’t be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I don’t think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap. Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.",Physics

"There's not really an answer to this question in the movie either. If I recall correctly they provide oxygen masks for inverted humans since you cannot breathe regular oxygen if you are inverted, and the protagonist gets hypothermia due to exposure to fire while inverted - suggesting you have a strange interaction with non-inverted matter while you yourself are inverted (and probably vice-versa?). You cannot drop an inverted bullet, but you can pick it up as it undoes being dropped at a later point in your timeline.\n\nBut then indeed, it should also mean that you cannot see uninverted light while you are inverted, but how would it work if say, the sun shines on an inverted object, how does non-inverted light reflect off of inverted surfaces? From the object's point of view, something happened that caused him to emit sunlight back at the sun, meaning you can calculate what light it must have shone onto it that caused it to emit sunlight (sunlight + what it should absorb). Therefore, shining regular light onto an inverted object causes it to emit... *more light*?",Physics

Now, yes there are a lot of specific nuances to this idea, but that's what research is for, right? Some issues to consider: how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome (not splitting important genes); ensuring regular but not too active transcription; would it lead to a sort of ""tolerance"" to the antigen, causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen.

"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology

It occurs after conjugation in some organisms, but conjugation is not necessary for plasmogamy, most organisms release spores or gametes into the environment therefore conjugation is mostly not required.\nKaryogamy is the fusion of the nucleus.

"I highly recommand Dehaene's work on the neural correlates of consciousness, because, as it turns out, we do know a great deal about the ""sit"" of consciousness and what it's made of.\n\n>After discussing the empirical tests able to identify what kinds of stimulus lead to conscious perception, as opposed to unconscious ones, he identifies four signatures of conscious access:\n\n> - The amplification of an early sensory signal leading it to an “ignition” of circuits in the parietal and prefrontal circuits\n> - The appearance of a slow P3 wave in an electroencephalogram, a slow massive wave throughout the parietal and prefrontal regions about 300 milliseconds after the stimulus\n> - A late and sudden burst of high frequency oscillations, gamma band power\n> - A synchronization of information exchanges across distant brain regions with oscillations in sync\n\n> All of this is referred to as “the conscious avalanche”, the widespread activation of neural activity in a network including the prefrontal and parietal regions whenever a perception makes it into consciousness.\n\n> Which leads to Dehaene’s theory of consciousness, the global neuronal workspace, a variation of Barnard Baars’ global workspace theory.  The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> …According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world. That’s because our brain has brought it into the workspace, which maintains it independently of the time and place at which we first perceived it.",Biology

"Not my expertise but no one's answered yet. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, please.\n\nAnyways, to answer, I'm seeing 2 alternatives to the cubic unit cell. The tetrahedron and a hexagonal thing. The hexagonal thing is not the simplest unit so it's pretty easy to see why that's not the unit cell. The tetrahedron I actually only see in your description and I'm reasonably certain the reason it doesn't work is that it does not contain enough information or atoms to rebuild the crystal structure. I'm actually not really seeing a tetrahedron. The best tetrahedron I can see is not regular by any stretch of the imagination and definitely won't tesselate to rebuild an entire crystal from that unit. Did you mean octahedron to include all the face centered atoms in the cubic crystal? The issue there is that if you tesselate the object, you'll skip a bunch of atoms. \n\nThe short answer would be that very smart people have worked on this for over a century and the cube is the simplest unit cell that can be tessellated to reproduce the entire crystal structure. If you have an alternate idea for the unit cell, I guarantee your missing something. You either will skip certain atoms when you tessellate, can't tessellate it at all, or you could create an alternate and simpler unit cell that will also work.",Chemistry

The force he experiences upon hitting the ground depends on the time it takes him to come to a full stop. That's because Johnny's change in momentum, which again is mass times velocity, is equal to the impulse he receives from the ground, which is force times time.

You can see from this why you have to be going super fast to get any time dilation: small β means the denominator is about 1, meaning the whole Lorentz factor is about 1. In the example above, the time on the ship t' would be about 1.000000056 times the time on the ground (so they are virtually identical) .  \n  \nThings start to pick up the fast you go though. If you were going at 99% the speed of light (β=.99), then you can plug into the equation above and find γ is about 7.

"This isn't the right narrative. The correct story is that there are at least two contributions to DE which sum up to the observed value. One of them comes from a generic prediction of QFTs. This term is, in fact, hard to calculate and depends on things that we can't yet probe. But it doesn't matter because there's another contribution from GR. This one is an integration constant. That is, it is a free parameter not predicted by anything. So the observed number is the number from QFT plus the number from GR. You can see that it doesn't matter what the QFT number is since you can get to any possible observed number by changing the number from GR to match.\n\nNow someone familiar with this topic knows that I have swept a big elephant under the rug. The numbers in question are a bit silly. The number from QFT seems to be something in the range of 10^120 times the measured value. So the GR number has to be 1-10^120 in the same units. Now, there's no problem with it being negative, but some physicists are surprised that these two seemingly unconnected areas of physics have two numbers that are so closely related.

"It’s unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didn’t even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earth’s temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. I’m not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely weren’t able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldn’t have replaced oil. It also wasn’t merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you don’t make a compelling case for why we shouldn’t try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.",Physics

"Just to be clear, gravity is extremely well understood since Einsteins General Relativity. So the premise of your question is already wrong.  \n\nOpen questions exist within the incredibly technical details when formulating a quantum field theory for gravity. But there is zero reason to speculate on a completely different ""mechanism"" for gravity based on pure guessing, thats just not how science works.\n\nOne remark on your idea, trying to relate gravity to magnetism just makes no sense. Even before Einstein, gravity in Newtonian physics and magnetism are just way to different: The gravitational field has monopoles, the magnetic field cannot have monopoles, only at least dipoles (every magnetic source ever has a north and a south pole, while there is only one gravitational charge aka mass). A gravitational field applies work on a test charge, a magnetic field doesn't. There are many other similar discrepancies, and these are only the most basic ones that everyone learns in their first year at university.\n\nAs a remark, I realize that all this may come of as a bit condescending, and it is good that you are interested in this stuff and try to think it through yourself. But the truth is, you won't solve any problems or even get the right ideas by guessing based on half-truths and half-knowledge. The only way is to have a deep foundation of both the mathematical theory and the supporting experimental evidence of the status quo, and then maybe inspire new ideas with a bit of intuition and guess work, combined with formulating it in a mathematical way, and thinking of testing the idea.",Physics

"The main problem is how we make them. We can make an atom or two at a time in a particle accelerator of basically all the super heavies, it's how we discovered basically all of them. We can also make macroscopic quantities up to Es or Fm in high neutron flux reactors (ie the HFIR at Oak Ridge). We're limited with how far we can go there because the half lives start getting too short for neutron capture to occur before the target decomposes. There ultimately isn't enough incentive to design a whole new reactor to slightly increase the yields of heavier isotopes of these elements because we still most likely won't be able to push further past Fm.\n\nMost of our current synthetic chemistry starts to not work very effectively on a µg scale which is why the state of the art is pretty much limited to Bk/Cf since Es and Fm are only available on sub-µg scales. Even the recent Es paper relied on a single spectroscopy that has an exceptionally low detection limit (XAS) rather than the traditional inorganic chemistry tool of SC-XRD, which requires a single crystal, typically of 10µg or more total mass.",Chemistry

"This is wrong, as has been mentioned elsewhere.\n\nWe know a ton about DM and it is not a placeholder for anything. We know how much of it there was at the point of last scattering due to precision measurements of the CMB's temperature temperature correlation (as well as from polarization information). We also know how much there was due to measurements of the abundances of light elements. It is because these two measurements agree that we *really* believe that DM is what we think it is. But we also know its radial profile in galaxies, that it doesn't interact with regular matter much, that it doesn't interact with itself much, that it clumps, that this clumpiness dictates the large scale structure of the universe, and probably other things that I'm forgetting. All of these things point to a self consistent picture of a cold fluid that has thermally evolved like matter and has been present in corresponding densities since the very early universe.\n\nA lot of non-physicists have this idea that DM is just rotation curves and nothing else. That is *not* why we believe DM exists, although it is one more data set that points to a consistent picture, and it is the first data set pointing towards DM, but far from the most precise.\n\nAs for DE, it is also not a placeholder. We see that we have recently (a few billion years ago) entered into a DE dominated era where the evolution of the Hubble parameter is increasingly dominated by DE. The primary data set for this is type 1a SNe. While this data set is tricky, there are a large number of independent checks of DE, notably intrinsic curvature. In addition, we have looked for higher order moments in the acceleration of the universe and not found any, suggesting that DE is what we think it is. Finally, we know that the equation of state of DE is close to -1 as expected from the cosmological constant.\n\nWhat is going on right now in these areas? Many things. For DM, people are using the open data from experiments like GAIA to detect substructures in the galactic DM halo, which is mind boggilingly awesome. As for DE, with upcoming experiments like Vera Rubin we will increase our SNe data set by orders of magnitude.\n\nFinally, the dark sector mentioned in this article isn't the same as dark energy or dark matter, although it could be. Despite the fact that these names all sound related and very vague - dark sector, dark matter, dark energy - they are distinct things. The article is about neutrinos and an anomaly at 4.8sig that just got weirder: obvious explanations don't work so people are turning to less obvious things. This is the way discoveries work. Something strange happens in the data (MiniBooNE sees an excess), the simplest interpretation is investigated (a sterile neutrino), so follow up experiments are built to robustly test this. MicroBooNE just reported their first test of MiniBooNE's excess and, in a different kind of experiment, they don't see it. But the MiniBooNE result has been checked to hell and back, it is pretty hard to believe that it is just an experimental problem, although it could be. Thus people are considering new physics scenarios other than sterile neutrinos and these scenarios often go under the umbrella term of dark sector, although it's a pretty shit name just like dark matter and dark energy.",Physics

Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question.

At that kinetic energy, your bottle of water would be travelling at 300 km/h or 200 mph.

That's why Australia has one of the highest percentages of skin cancer in the world.

That's why black people often lack vitamin D in North america and northern Europe, and often have to take supplements.",Biology
"In quantum field theory (which we know to work pretty damn well), in principle there are certain processes that are allowed to happen. Those processes are called ""Charge-Parity symmetry violating"". There's one parameter (called Θ) in our equations that determines how frequent those processes should occur, and this is something we have to measure experimentally and cannot derive theoretically, just like the masses of particles, their charges or how strong certain interactions are.\n\nAnd we experimentally find that those processes...have never occured once since we started looking for them in the 70's. So, it's pretty plausible that the parameter Θ is zero. We can't know for sure, though, and it could also be super super tiny.\n\nWell, it turns out that if this parameter Θ isn't just a fixed number, but another quantum mechanical field, then it would automatically cause those processes to never occur. Of course, this is a slightly more complex mechanism (replacing a number with a field), but it would work perfectly - and this is basically what we also did with particle masses. Before we treated them as pure numbers, but then Higgs came up with the idea that those might be caused by a field. And every field comes with a particle attached to it, and as you might have heard, we found that Higgs-particle.\n\nSo, if there is a field for our parameter Θ, then this also comes with another particle, and this is the axion. The existence of this particle would immediatly solve our original problem of possible processes never occuring, it would also be very, very light and have all the properties we need for a dark matter particle. And us cosmologists need dark matter to explain a lot about the universe - there seems to be a lot more mass in the universe than we can find. And we notice this lack of mass in many, many different scenarios.\n\nThe axion could easily solve two of the biggest outstanding problems in physics, the strong CP problem and the dark matter problem. And it comes as natural as the Higgs-mechanism. It's almost too good to be true.",Physics

"I highly recommand Dehaene's work on the neural correlates of consciousness, because, as it turns out, we do know a great deal about the ""sit"" of consciousness and what it's made of.\n\n>After discussing the empirical tests able to identify what kinds of stimulus lead to conscious perception, as opposed to unconscious ones, he identifies four signatures of conscious access:\n\n> - The amplification of an early sensory signal leading it to an “ignition” of circuits in the parietal and prefrontal circuits\n> - The appearance of a slow P3 wave in an electroencephalogram, a slow massive wave throughout the parietal and prefrontal regions about 300 milliseconds after the stimulus\n> - A late and sudden burst of high frequency oscillations, gamma band power\n> - A synchronization of information exchanges across distant brain regions with oscillations in sync\n\n> All of this is referred to as “the conscious avalanche”, the widespread activation of neural activity in a network including the prefrontal and parietal regions whenever a perception makes it into consciousness.\n\n> Which leads to Dehaene’s theory of consciousness, the global neuronal workspace, a variation of Barnard Baars’ global workspace theory.  The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> …According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world. That’s because our brain has brought it into the workspace, which maintains it independently of the time and place at which we first perceived it.",Biology

Saying he’s “crossing his fingers” or “trying to guess the laws of physics” in Sean’s own words. If you want to know more, this theory is based off the 2002 book ANKS which has been criticized by Scott Aaronson. The problem with the current theory according to Aaronson is that not much has changed and his critiques remain the same as he said in a QnA (I believe in July).",Physics

"The long answer to your question would be that your terms need to be properly defined. The short answer is maybe.\n\nThere are two distinct types of empathy: cognitive empathy, which is similar to theory of mind, the ability to understand how others think and feel. The second is affective empathy, which is sharing the physical experience of somebody else’s emotions. So, if somebody is feeling nervous, somebody high in affective empathy would also feel nervous. These are distinct traits. However, being high in either doesn’t necessarily mean you’re compassionate. Somebody could have high cognitive empathy, and just not care how others feel, or can justify their reasons for hurting others, or are supported by cultural norms or beliefs. Somebody with affective empathy might be overcome by their emotions to the point that they’re not able to be compassionate because they’re overwhelmed.\n\nFurthermore, the trouble with compassion is that we are not equally compassionate to all people in all contexts. I recall something from Sapolsky’s ‘Behave’ about women who have stronger ‘in groups’ display more empathy among each other, but show equal fear and disdain of out groups. So those who are more empathetic to their friends, are also less empathetic to strangers. Should we call that person ‘high empathy’ or ‘low empathy’? Neither seems to fit and the label is meaningless without the understanding of the context.\n\nSo, the question is kind of unanswerable because its too general. Studies of human behaviour are only meaningful within the context of the study and can’t be easily extrapolated.\n\nIn common parlance, ‘empathy’ is just a pseudoscience term for being a nice person. But, what is ‘nice’ is culturally relative and dependant on who we’re meant to be ‘nice’ to.",Biology

"You make some good points, but I think it’s important to recognize that carbon capture companies that sequester their carbon rather than using it for energy would be making money primarily via government funding. \n\nYes, they could in principle come to rely on there being more CO2 emitted so that it was worth it for the plant to be functioning, but this would only be an issue if the government was unable to pass laws that required a switch to clean energy. You could argue that CO2 capture technology and companies are bad because they might enable fossil fuel use rather than switching over to renewables, so that the government wouldn’t pass legislation that reduced fossil fuel consumption. On a practical level, this type of argument is a reasonable concern, and I think that it’s important to keep in the public discourse around carbon capture. At the same time, direct air capture had the potential to be so valuable in terms of removing historic CO2 emissions that I don’t think we should just ignore it because of its potential to be misused. Another nice side effect of CO2 capture technology is that many of the materials useful for carbon capture are similar to materials used to capture pollutants or toxic elements both from gas streams and water, and these types of small molecule adsorbents might prove to be very good for human and environmental health.",Physics

"If you want better answers you need to ask better questions.  Im not trying to be condescending but you would do yourself a huge favor by getting a better grasp on chemistry before trying to grasp molecular biology.  At this point you are asking things that are explained in middle school science classes before they even call the class chemistry, or at least my middle school called it Science class.  A gas has atoms less densely packed than a liquid or solid.  A nebulizer  uses an atomizer to disperse the drug and in turn and intrinsically turns it into a gas or at least decreases the droplet size small enough to be inhaled without choking.  The less mass something has the less effect gravity has on it.  Something under about 80nm is uneffected by gravity.  Although the droplets are larger than this they do have such little mass at those sizes that they are temporarily suspended in air.  This is essentially a fog not steam.  Of course steam is acting on similar principles and is also lifted into the air by thermodynamics. Speaking of your earlier example of liquids those are suspensions in liquids usually mostly water with some flavoring to make it easier to swallow whereas a nebulizer or inhaler is a suspension in air. Gases mix homogeneously without even mixing like a liquid.  At this point it is getting a bit difficult to explain to you because you are requiring an explanation of underpinnings that should be understood and implied.  Again see basic chemistry and physics.

Chemistry is broad and it doesn't mean you will be qualified for any one job or that a job will be given to you.

"MiniBooNE and LSND both saw excesses of events that haven't been explained.\n\nThis experiment, MicroBooNE was designed to be able to more accurately probe that excess (using the same beam as MiniBooNE but with a better detector), and looked in the same place for either an electron-like or a photon-like excess that could explain the MiniBooNE result, and it wasn't there.

The rope is pulled down by its own weight, but is trying to be blown horizontal by the air resistance. At the top of the rope, there is more weight from the rope below pulling down, so the air resistance is less able to blow it sideways and the rope hangs straight-er down. Nearer the bottom there is less weight pulling down on the rope, so the air resistance can blow the rope horizontally more easily.",Physics

You can cool a saturated solution or, as someone mentioned, carefully layer a solvent and anti-solvent (and, if you wish, cool it as well).

Since space is infinitely more massive than water in the tube, it will seem like a unidirectional force and thus 'free energy', even though the system is trying just as hard to suck the sparse particles in as to push water up. Moving the water just ends up being infinitely easier, and thus the outcome that ends up occuring.",Physics

"Consider any point along the rope. The question now is, how is air resistance and gravity affecting the rope beneath it? That determines in which direction the rope beneath that point is pulling that point on the rope.\n\nWell, gravity is proportional to the mass of that length of rope, which is proportional to the length of the rope.\n\nAir resistance is proportional to the wind-facing surface area of the rope, which is *also* proportional to the length of the rope.\n\nSince these are both proportional to length, as you move down the rope, neither the downward effect of gravity or the approximately horizontal effect of air resistance is able to pull ahead, and the rope is just pulled in the same direction for the entire length.\n\n----\n\nHere is a more mathematically rigorous explanation:\n\nConsider an arbitrary length of the rope.\n\nIgnoring other attached segments of rope (which should behave identically), and thus their tension forces, there are two forces acting on the rope: gravity, and air resistance.\n\nNet air resistance is proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's wind-facing area is proportional to its length.\n\nNet gravitational force is *also* proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's mass is proportional to its length.\n\nThus, the net force is given by:\n\n- **F**_net = **F**_a + **F**_g = L\***f**_a + L\***f**_g = L\*(**f**_a + **f**_g)\n\nwhere **F**_a and **F**_g are air resist. and gravity, L is rope length, and **f**_a and **f**_g are the ""per-length"" air resist. and gravity forces.\n\nSince the rope is of uniform mass, **f**_g is constant for the entire rope, since gravity is approximately constant along the whole rope, which is short compared to the size of the Earth.\n\nIf we assume approximately constant air velocity and air density/makeup around the entire length of the rope, then we also get that **f**_a is constant for the entire rope.\n\nSince **f**_a and **f**_g are constant for the whole rope, so is there sum. This means that we have:\n\n- **F**_net = L\***k**\n\nwhere **k** = **f**_a + **f**_g is a constant vector.\n\nAll this math has resulted in the above equation, which alone tells us the rope should be straight and look like (B). The net force for every segment of rope along the rope, before accounting for tension forces, is in the same direction. When you add tension forces, those will only act parallel or anti-parallel to this net force.\n\nThus, the net force along the entire rope will be parallel to a constant direction, which is a straight line.",Physics

[https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/MariaPereyra.shtml](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/MariaPereyra.shtml) Gives us the slowest speed of a shotgun slug at about 335 m/s, and if we are goint to take the .2s reaction time from the first article as our standard, that means we need to be about 67m away to have any time at all to move, and we need to add on the amount of time (and therefore distance) we need to actually do the moving. A 12 gauge shotgun slug is about 18mm accross so let's say that's how far you need to move your hand to not get hit. How long does it take someone to move their hand 18mms? I have no idea and no clue how I'd find that out, but I'd bet it's not very long. Let's call it a tenth of a second, not including reaction time. So that gives us a range of about 99m. All of this is assuming, of course, that you only notice the shot when it just leaves the barrel. It doesn't take into account the tiny bits of time it takes for a trigger pull to translate into a hammer strike, and the travel down the barrel, which would give you more time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if someone shoots at the edge of your body, with a slow shotgun slug, from across a football field, yeah probably. Looking it up some, a 12 gauge is still accurate at that range, but with a significantly decreased amount of force, so your dodge is probably helpful, if you pick the right direction.",Biology

Cheap detergents are more likely to leave white residues - when the washer goes into a dry cycle - the water evaporates away and the residue becomes baked on. \n\nIt can also be from hard water. For instance if you had hard water in the bottle (even residual after like a hand wash) and left the bottle to dry - the dissolved solids in your water will stay behind even though water is gone. It’s like when you leave  a full cup of water sit for a long period of time - where the water level used to be - but is no longer - there is a white film. That’s those dissolved solids.

With such examples as quantum beat phenomena, the quantum eraser, and certain two-photon interference phenomena, as discussed later in this book,\nit becomes necessary to think of the photon as a quantum mechanical entity whose basic physics is much deeper than the semiclassical theory plus vacuum fluctuation logic.”\nQuantum optics Scully and Zubairy page 20",Physics

"Caramelization is accelerated at both high and low pH. However, caramelization is a large class of chemical reactions and the pH will change which products are formed. The main type of reaction is dehydration.\n\nAt high pH, you will see more polymerization of the sugars, forming large, conjugated molecules that absorb light giving you more browning. At low pH, you will see more small-molecule dehydration products like furans that contribute more to flavor but browning will be slower. \n\nAs for bread browning and flavor, both caramelization and the Maillard reaction will occur. The Maillard reaction is significantly inhibited at low pH. It involves the reaction of amino acids and reducing sugars. At low pH, the amino acids are protonated and become poor nucleophiles, so the Maillard reaction is slowed. It will still occur, however, and lead to different products just like caramelization.\n\nLow pH Maillard products generally have more meaty aromas while high-pH Maillard products generally have more roasty and nutty aromas.",Chemistry

"Yup, I think this might be the best observation. There are some megataxonomies of viruses that emerged prior to LUCA, and their genomes also work with the standard twenty amino acids. So, while observing that both archaea and bacteria use all twenty may show that at least LUCA used these twenty amino acids, that all viruses also use them suggests a far more primitive, probably pre-cellular adoption to the twenty amino acids.\n\nSomeone could argue that it's possible that all megataxonomies of viruses only adopted the standard twenty after LUCA and only later evolved towards the current system as a result of evolution. So, while it seems quite implausible, the argument may go that it is at least *possible* this doesn't prove viruses indicate an earlier origins of the twenty amino acids than LUCA. But it turns out that LUCAs own genome is filled with viruses that used the standard twenty amino acids. So LUCAs own virome helps confirm an earlier origins of the twenty.

">To address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. \n\nA slight correction to this -- the CO2 doesn't really *re-emit* the photon.  Instead the absorbed photon excites the ro-vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule, effectively increasing its kinetic energy, which is then re-distributed to other molecules (such as N2, O2, H2O) in the atmosphere upon collisions, effectively leading to increased kinetic energy content (=temperature) of the atmosphere.  This difference in the process is crucial for understanding the fine details of the greenhouse effect; however, it is almost trivial at the same time, given that the black-body radiation (mostly IR for something at \~300K) of a substance is temperature-dependent.",Physics

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/YufGuTz.png) is a plot I just found from googling, it's in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11033) paper which is in PRD. The x-axis is the scale factor which is related to time; the right side is today, the left side was a long time ago. The y-axis is the fractional energy density. Don't worry about the different line styles, they are details of the specific model in this paper. But in general we see that the universe used to be radiation dominated (teal), but radiation redshifts away very quickly and its energy density goes like a^-4 . Next we have a matter^1 (brown) dominated region since its energy density decreases only like a^-3 . But there is also dark energy (purple) whose energy density remains constant in time: a^0 . So it was always there but when you realize the x-axis is logarithmic, it isn't surprising that each one turns on/off fairly suddenly.\n\nAs for the future, see LSST now VRO, their physics cases are outlined [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2366). Their expected sensitivity is shown [here](https://i.imgur.com/6lFJyne.png) in terms of the equation of state and the evolution of the equation of state.

We know its equation of state. We know its redshift evolution. It is consistent with the model expectation from a cosmological constant. The precision on these measurements are quite good. It continues to survive robustness tests.

So it's better to at least use the right words so people can connect what they're reading here with what they've read and heard elsewhere. And it's not like oscillations is a unfamiliar word.\n\nThe fact that neutrinos oscillate implies that there are almost certainly sterile neutrinos; the presence of a 1 eV sterile or not does not change that.

"Yes, top research jobs usually go to PhD and ScDs.  AS degreed applicants are usually hired as technicians.  BS chemists are sort of caught in the middle.  Don't restrict your field of fire for those resumes.  Research labs are not the only place where chemists are hired.  Consider manufacturing plant positions.  Third shift if necessary to get your foot in the door.  Consider chemical sales jobs. Or technical writing jobs.

It's pretty obvious that knowledge of a foreign language will vastly reduce the pool of competitors for positions in global chemical companies or those who want or need to deal internationally.  But not so obvious is that if you can play the violin, you will be irresistible to a lab where there is already a cellist and a pianist.  A chemist who plays golf will have an advantage in a company with a golf culture.  Third, use your computer skills.  Research companies and institutions and their employees and management for intelligence and places where your interests are a fit.  If you are a bowler, find organizations with a bowling team or league. Target or retarget nearby chemist employers.  Locate the bar nearest to the lab and frequent it at lunch time.  Or if your research turns up information that a manager is active in a civic organization, join up.  Remember to tell yourself as a chemist, you are a problem solver.

There are a lot of underlying conditions you may be missing, I will give you some food for thought:\n1) Under Quantum Mechanics formalism (QM), energy conservation is not to be understood in the same way you may have under Classical Mechanics. The most striking example of this is the tunneling of particles through a potential greater than its total mechanical energy. But this is not the only one. See the Casimir force, for example;\n2) In your setup, you are probably taking your 'detectors' as perfect ones, which never miss any detection and does not give false positive. Even in a thought experiment, it is hard to conciliate this with QM formalism. Either way, supposing you have one, you are entering the 'spooky action at distance'. See the debate between Einstein and Bohr on this subject, where Einstein states what was later known as EPR paradox. I consider this a very important criticism because - although Einstein were proved wrong at the end, its questioning gave rise to a whole new field of QM, known as the QM contextuality. The first concise steps in this new field were given by Bell, which stated his famous 'inequality', I suggest you to have a try on this too;\n3) The true answer to your question is: the speed at which this 'information of detection' should travel is not relevant. What is known is that it happens as long as you adquire information about the system, you have your 'colapse'. Also, it does not violate classical energy conservation, because in the long run, i.e., in the limit where you have a long enough number of trials, total energy will be conserved. If you search for the arguments and references I've mentioned in step 2, you will inevitably end in the so called 'Hidden Variables Theory', which is in fact the begining of the contextuality problem.",Physics
hi,Physics
I remember doing a review for Ideonella Saikainesis? Its the bacteria that was discovered in Japan that can use PHET plastics as a sole carbon source for metabolism but it does the process very long so its not feasible to just use them for breaking down those types of plastics. Could be about that since ocean plastics are big on the news.\n\nAnother is antibiotic resistance in microbes that can affect us plus agriculture. Lots of stuff,Biology

"""Why"" is kind of a trap when talking about evolutionary biology. Things gain and lose not just based on what sees them through to reproduce, but also for no reason at all. Why did humans develop different colored irises? There's an argument to be made for sexual preference of mates, but it doesn't offer any direct benefit for survival necessarily besides absorbing different amounts of light. I have very light blue eyes and I'm miserable in the sun, but I can have a kid just fine and pass on that trait. If blue eyed people were so inhibited by their blue eyes, we'd die out before we were able to reproduce, but it's just one of those things that has a negligible impact on reproduction.\n\nSo, why do soybeans have more proteins? A bean at one point in time developed a mutation in their DNA and they generate more amino acids and it didn't inhibit their ability to reproduce, or maybe it actually improved their ability to reproduce or adapt to environments, and that's probably cutting edge soybeanology, might be a good topic for a paper.  ""How"" did soybeans start making more amino acids and how did that not impact their survival (i.e., how did their proteins not all clump up and kill them) is biochemistry stuff.\n\nFor the philosophers, I'll leave the wise words of my friend Joe Dirt: ""[""Why's a tree good?

"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell. Sounds counter intuitive, but that's just because writing it out in words introduces imprecisions.",Physics

"I respectfully disagree (to an extent). I will make the argument that we still have no idea what’s going on. Can we make predictions on what’s going to happen?

"Disease is a big factor. New strains of viruses and bacteria appear (or change in frequency) every year, making pathogen-resistance alleles come and go as well, almost like yearly fashion trends.\n\nThere are planktonic animals that make resting stages (e.g. eggs) that sink to the bottom of the pond and can stay in suspended animations for several years. In [one classic study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06291), old resting stages of *Daphnia* (along with their pathogens) were dug out of the mud and reanimated. This is basically like using a time machine to hop back and forth and systematically cross-expose parasites and hosts from different time periods. One cool result was that the pathogens tended to be more able to infect *Daphnia* from the same year, showing that pathogens evolve to become especially good at infecting whatever genotypes are in the host population at the moment.\n\nWeather is another big factor. For species that reproduce fast, it can even change the population within a single year. There's a really cool study system of wild fruit flies in orchards in North America. The researchers working in the orchards have shown that allele frequencies change every year from spring to fall, as the weather becomes warmer and warmer, favoring genotypes that are good at living in warm conditions (the same alleles that are more common farther south, in fact). Then winter comes, and the population is ""reset"" as genotypes that are good at handling cold become favored instead. So it's easy to see how warm years and cold years would have a similar effect.",Biology

"Looks like an assassin bug!\nThe wheel bug, Arilus cristatus, is North Carolina’s largest assassin bug. It gets its name from the prominent spiny “wheel” found on the thorax. Both nymphs and adults are generalist predators that feed on a variety of insects including aphids, caterpillars, bugs, beetles, and more. The bug uses its stout beak to inject the prey insect with a toxin that kills it within 30 seconds. Most of their prey are pest insects so they are considered beneficial to farmers and gardeners. They move slowly and are clumsy fliers. Their bite has been described as being more painful than a wasp sting so they should be admired but not handled\n\nRead more at: https://growingsmallfarms.ces.ncsu.edu/2020/04/birth-assassin-bug/",Biology

If that is happening combining two streams gets you the same max temperature. But since some heat would immediately lost to surrounding air, having two flames in the area seems like it would mean less surrounding air to transfer heat to.\n\nWould it double the temperature, no. Increase, probably.\n\nNow if you could safely preheat the gasses in the second burner with the first, then it seems you could almost double the temperature.

"Okay that makes more sense to me. In that case, it's either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing. It's probably not kinetic but just in case, you could try cooling it more slowly. Idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water. I don't think this will work but maybe.\n\nOtherwise, the issue seems to be one of partitioning. You have 2 phases, either stearic acid in the SLN or the lipid tails of the tween 20. As is, they are virtually identical. Both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains. Could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase? Clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances, it should still prefer aromatic substances. If you can up the aromatic content of your SLN, it might stay in place more. Aromatic body friendly things seem rare though. Cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe? Some vitamin B's or E look promising. Tryptophan might even work. \n\nCome to think of it, the whole thing is weird to me. It's a little weird that you have SLN's and micelles both existing. It seems like there's just too much surfactant as it means your covering the SLN's entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc. But the other bit that's weird is that a drug dissolved in a SOLID lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase. If it's solid, it shouldn't really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase. So... kinetics might not actually be far off. I was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the SLN formation. If you can get the SLN's formed before diluting, you should be golden. But I'm guessing that's the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise. I'm kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water. It will fall out of solution, but if it forms the right sized particles, you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing and/or sonication, resuspend the stearic acid mixture. Even if you are forming micelles, it should be solid already and avoid the issue. But it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension. Who knows? Concentration is still probably the best bet.",Chemistry

I know some people sometimes mention IMB for atmospheric since they did have the data before SK, but they didn't interpret it correctly, most likely because they were afraid of claiming a mixing angle ~45deg. I also didn't include Double Chooz since they don't really get the frequency, although I could have pointed out that DB, RENO, and DC all agree on theta13.\n\nAs for what other particles might be included, there are lots of options. Higgs triplets and Majorons are fairly common.

"I worked on this experiment. AMA\n\nBoron-10 has a high capture cross section for neutrons, and the cross section increases as 1/v. The neutrons in this experiment are ""ultacold neutrons"" (E < a few hundred neV) so 10B has a very high capture cross section. The capture reaction is 10B (n,alpha) 7Li.\n\nThe detector is built like a sandwich. On the outer edges are ~20 nm of 10B. The interior layer is ZnS, a scintillator. In the middle there is acrylic that has wavelength-shifting fibers (WLSF) built into it. From left to right, the structure is 10B : ZnS : acrylic and WLSF : ZnS : 10B.\n\nWhen a neutron captures on 10B either an alpha or a 7Li passes through the ZnS, and the scintillation light is gathered into the WLSF. The WLSF carry the light to the PMTs, and from there the signal can be digitized. One key feature of this detector is that the WLSF are laid out in alternating fashion, so adjacent WLSF transmit light to different PMTs. This allows for us to look for coincident signals between two PMTs, which significantly suppresses (and more importantly, stabilizes!) background noise from ~250 Hz to ~0.5 Hz.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics

"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",Biology

I think those really are the choices, if the bike doesn't fall that means it is going straight when it is balanced or the handlebar rotates, making the bike turn.\n\n> But what’s left behind is the tilt\n\nGoing straight, there has to be a stable position, the forces need to be balanced. There can't be any inertia (other than in the forward direction), that permanently angles the bike to one side or the other. In your example, once the bike has rotated, the inertia to the right will either mean you tilt to the right and ultimately fall over to the right, or it will be slowed by a force coming from the contact between your bike and the road. As soon as you go forward, there isn't any total net inertia in another direction per definition (or you would move that way).\n\nAssuming the bike doesn't slip, it will rotate around the point where it touches the ground. A force on the right means a net torque to the right\n\n    _____\n      |  |\n      |  \/\n      |\n      |\n\nmeans the bike will tilt left (or turn, or fall).\n\n    _____\n      \  |\n       \ \/\n        \\n         \",Physics

"I'm sure someone will write on a way cleaner way since i'm going from memory.  \nAll of them come from the 3 dimensional wave function, do note that the 3d z\^2 may also be written as 3d z\^2 - r\^2 (after all, you'll probably be solving it in spherical coordinates and later returning to cartesian coordinates). If you really want to know more specific details such as where do each wave function comes from and how to write them you'll have to look on a quantum mechanics books, the expressions can get quite extensive.   \nWith that in mind, the squares can be easilly associated with the probability densities (squared wave function), since that is what you'll be seeing the orbital plots, and with some (really large) degree of freedom of speech, try to imagine the xy, xz, zy as solutions where the variables are correlated, justifying the fact that is never purely in the x or y (and so on) axis. For the x\^2 - y\^2 think of them as a linear combination of non-correlated variables to form the general solution, thus the highest probability wont be on a region where the (x\^2 , y\^2) combination is at it's maximum but where either (x\^2 , 0) or (0, y\^2) is being maximized.   \nThe biggest problem with this analogy comes from the z\^2 - r\^2 one, here you'll need to have some revolution solids in mind, since it's quite easy to see that the density regions are separated by a 3-dimensional cone instead of a traditional cartesian axis, that's where the r\^2 may help to visualize its formation. Try plotting a surface such as z\^2 - x\^2 - y\^2 and note that the 3d z\^2 solution lies inside the cone and around it.   \nHowever, do realize, this is just an (way) overly simplified justification, you'll need to check the wavefunction solution for each case to really get a picture of whats going on behind the scene and it's now that hard to find a table of such solutions. I'm pretty sure you'll be able to check some of the formal definitions on a book such as Quantum Chemistry by Levine, they come mostly from working the Hydrogen Atom but there's plenty of nuances on its treatment and **i would not recommend taking my analogy on word alone**.",Chemistry

First, rather than direct air capture people are working on capturing CO2 from a coal or natural gas flue stream. As mentioned in my previous comment, a coal plant will produce a good deal more CO2 than a natural gas plant will for the same amount of energy generated, but this actually doesn’t matter so much for the point I’m trying to make besides making it likely that you would want a different adsorbent material for the the two cases. If what you’re saying is correct, this work would be a completely pointless endeavor. In order to capture the CO2 from the fossil fuel plants, you would have to generate as much energy as they are generating with renewables. There would be no reason to do this if you were correct, yet this is a very active area of research that gets funding from the DOE and other sources. This is more of “proof by authority” than actually addressing your point with a physical argument, but I mention this because it’s one of the main reasons that I initially was skeptical of your claim. There are likely many hundreds or thousands of scientists currently working on, evaluating, and funding this type of research that your apparently simple argument based on the second law of thermodynamics renders pointless. It seems unlikely to me that so many people just haven’t considered this claim, especially since process modeling on the economic and materials cost of these materials is common as well and in that type of modeling, they develop sophisticated thermodynamic and kinetic models of CO2 capture in specific materials. They wouldn’t continue doing this if it were as simple as just having to input as much energy as you initially got out since then it would be a pointless task. \n\nThe second example is one I alluded to in my previous comment. Suppose in one case that all of our historical emissions were from coal plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_c. Suppose in another case that all of our emissions were from natural gas plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_n. In both cases there would be the same amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but E_n > E_c since natural gas emits less CO2 than coal for the same amount of energy generated.  By your argument, in these two scenarios, we would have to generate different amounts of energy to capture this carbon dioxide. This doesn’t make sense, however. Once the carbon dioxide is in the air, it doesn’t matter how it got there. We aren’t trying to turn the CO2 back into coal or back into natural gas. Instead we are trying to get it to bind to some material, and the energy required to make the material and unbind the CO2 later (if that’s required for storing it underground) will be fixed for the same material capturing CO2 from the atmosphere, regardless of the source of the CO2 initially. The material doesn’t care if the CO2 came from coal or a fire or from a person breathing. \n\nTo address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. After absorbing light it doesn’t permanently stay in an excited state. \n\nYour fart example misses the point again. The point of carbon capture isn’t to end up with coal or natural gas or whatever else as a byproduct of CO2 capture. The point is going from coal -> CO2 (and other things) -> CO2 bound to some material. It isn’t trying to make something a reversible process.",Physics

"As a chemistry the advice I always give in my office hours is to solve equation based problems in the reverse of how the solutions are shown in class.\n\nStart by figuring out what the question is asking for as the answer. Then start solving from an equation that has that value in it. (Early on in chemistry there will be only one or two equations that you know with the target variable, so it's a safe starting point) \n\nNext go stepwise through that equation and for each variable see if it's given to you directly by the problem. \n\nFor the remaining variables not given directly in the problem, find another equation that has that variable in it, and substitute that into the original equation.\n\nthen repeat going step twice through that new addition equation identifying which variables are given to you in the problem. Repeat for all unknown variables. If you sub in an equation and pretty much everything in it is not given to the problem try a different equation.\n\nI recommend not putting any numbers in until the very end. Keep the whole thing as an alphabet soup. You'll get lots of partial credit that way even if you mess up. Then for the very last step, show each number that you sub in and solve for the value of the variable the problem is asking for.

"When you're body has built up an immunity to a virus, certain immune cells have developed proteins which can recognise the same viral antigens so they can quickly start destroying the virus. Those cells can also send out chemical signals (cytokines) which can induce a variety of effects on all kinds of cells. For example these can increase body temperature, increase mucous production, constrict airways etc all the common illness symptoms. But usually these pass a lot quicker as your immune killer cells can remove the infection at a much quicker rate.",Biology

"Great question!  It does in fact take more power to maintain a constant acceleration at increasing speed.   You can manipulate basic equations around to come up with P = F x V which clearly jibes perfectly with your observation that KE is exponentially increasing with constant acceleration.   So how do you explain a rocket, is it getting free energy (or free power) from a constant thrust force?  The answer is no of course, so what’s actually happening?   At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because it’s velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.   Keep in mind we’re not doing relativity here, so from a stationary vantage point, with constant rocket acceleration you see each progressive bit of rocket exhaust coming out with a slower and slower absolute downward velocity.  It has less and less power going into it, which cancels with the rocket’s increasing power given by F x V.",Physics

"Sorry if I was brief above, but you just told the wrong narrative. The contribution cancellation you describe may hold at any given loop-order in the perturbative expansion of the vacuum energy coming from QFT. The problem with gravity is that it’s non-renormalizable. If you did the procedure you discuss above at a given loop-order, at the next level of the expansion, you’d have to perform another tuning, one independent of the first. QFT’s vacuum energy is radiatively unstable in the presence of classical GR. \n\nFurthermore, in saying the QFT prediction is terrible, I meant that if one wanted the 1-loop contribution to be THE dark energy, one would hope that contribution matches the observed value, or is close. Due to the mismatch, one has to rely on a fine tuning which then removes the ability to predict the vacuum energy.\n\nFinally, this all assumes that DE is a cosmological constant (cc), which isn’t actually required by the data.

"For me, biology was a lot of memorization in the first 5 classes or so, and chemistry was much more “learn a set of skills” and problem solve with them.\n\nNot sure why some people are telling you chemistry isn’t.  If you genuinely like and are good at chemistry, you memorize a few things and then problem solve the rest.  Look into organic chemistry.  It’s very puzzle-like.  I took like 70 hours of chemistry as an undergrad- it’s far more applied than memorization.\n\nGranted, I’m now transitioning over to computational chemistry after doing an organic chemistry PhD and 4 years of medicinal chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, so take that with whatever grain of salt you want.\n\nThe one thing I’ll say is that unlike in school, where you’re applying known things to answer questions, chemistry bench research is far slower.  It’s much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, it’s much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out it’s not working to figuring out why it’s not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, there’s almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesn’t work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.

"Any idea what the material is?\n\nI don't think it's dry cleaning solvent.  Those chemicals are either going to be odor-free kerosene or perchlorinated solvents (highly volatile and it evaporates off in seconds).  They don't smell.  They don't react with water.  They don't leave residue.  The chemicals are a type of oil.  Realistically, you never get clothing back from a dry cleaner that is still wet with solvent or coated in a magic invisible layer of protective chemicals.\n\nSome fabric materials do decompose over time.  Synthetics or natural rubber elastic.  Those decomposition products can react with water to release very astringent sulfur or acid compounds.\n\nThe clothing may have contained mold and you had a allergic reaction to some of the decomposition products.  Best way to describe it is smelly very bitter and sharp.\n\nThe other culprit is usually decaying skin and body oils.  Those smell like rancid oils.  It's the slightly off-smell you get in vintage stores.  Sometimes it's stronger than others and you need a strong mechanical thrashing to remove it.\n\nOverall: agree with everyone else.  Take it to a dry cleaner.  They can ID the material and use the correct chemicals to treat the problem.",Chemistry

"Hmm.  I would submit that many if not most highly-successful models in physics are or at least started out as exactly that:  hacks, as you've defined them here.  Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today — these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics — or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people — humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension — are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.  And it seems to me that idea extends to natural law as much as it extends to the ""content"" of nature (matter, and how the world/cosmos is arranged, etc.).\n\nThoughts?  Cheers,",Physics

"Consider a vertical cryogenic liquid storage tank (say liquid nitrogen) where the pressure in the vapour space is 1000 kPa. Liquid nitrogen is supplied out of this tank, from an outlet at the bottom of the tank. No pump, just liquid decant/gravity fed out. I understand the liquid at the outlet is subject to a force according to the height of liquid above it (and density, gravity). \n\n- To what degree does the 1000kpa of pressure in the vapour space affect the liquid that is 'pushed out' the bottom outlet? Does this pressure apply a force on liquid below the surface at all? \n- if we consider the liquid level height and the vapour pressure as variables, which will be a more significant factor in how 'quickly', or with how much force the liquid is pushed out the bottom?\n\nIt's been a few years since uni and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. I keep thinking intuitively if you put a second outlet just below the surface level of the liquid, I would expect the flow out of this to be less than the flow out the bottom. But I can't find a way to separate the forces/show that the liquid head is the determining factor. I tried to calculate the liquid height force (rho*g*h) and compare to the force due to pressure of the gas, but the gas pressure came out much larger lol.\n\nIs it simply that the vapour pressure only acts on the surface boundary and below that the 'pressure' on the liquid is due to the liquid height?\n\nThanks!!",Physics

"I'll disagree with saying dopamine is ""the cause"" of addiction. Here's my view. Addiction is a lock and key. If you gave Adderall to a large random sample some would hate it, some would not. Some fraction would be more mentally effective but not addicted, and some would become addicted regardless of any pharmacological benefit.\n\nAn example: I was on morphine for about 2 weeks after serious surgery when I was in my early 20s. I was taken off of it fairly suddenly when I went home. I had physical withdrawal but didn't realize it, and called my doctor with ""odd"" symptoms. He literally laughed on the phone but didn't say why, and gave me a prescription for a tranquilizer for a week or two. A few days later a friend explained it. So, did I crave opiates when I went off, or after I found out what happened? No. Would I have considered it taking it if I could somehow get it free and safely? Not even a little. I have a life to lead, thank you. What about years later when I went through chronic depression and had had personal experience or familiarity with more addictive things? No, never called to me. Does that make me better than an addict? Absolutely not, just lucky in that particular way. \n\nAs a baseline (possibly genetic), most people have very low to moderately low vulnerability to addiction, but more is fairly common. If someone with significant baseline potential is in a situation of chronic pain, either physical or emotional, their vulnerability goes up rapidly in proportion to the pain.\n\nEmotional pain can be things people don't even realize is pain because they've normalized it. Low self esteem, a bad marriage, a sense of failure, a phobia or chronic anxiety, fear about a large scale issue like climate change, or chronic hate (at the government, women, themselves, or whatever).\n\nWhy have addiction rates skyrocketed in the US? You don't have to be anyplace on the political spectrum, and barely awake, to know the problem. Suicide and crime rates skyrocketing. Obesity and diabetes skyrocketing. People hate social media and use it more than ever. Ever larger corporations and no privacy. The country has been gradually tearing itself apart more and more.\n\nThere is one and only one trigger for addiction rates climbing ever since The US Vietnam War and 60's social strife, up through the (current) pandemic and strife. One trigger: increasing chronic, individual pain. Any coincidence that the steepest climb in addictions lately is in pain medication? I think not.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

"The journal doesn't normally analyse the data, they review the manuscript and the data that is presented. The way it works is that you submit a paper to a journal and the editor makes a decision on whether or not the paper should go to peer review. If yes, then the paper is sent to somewhere between one and three referees, who ideally are experts within the field, and who thoroughly scrutinize the manuscript and the presented results. That doesn't involve them re-analyzing the data, partially because that would simply be a too time consuming a process to have as a standard practice. Instead it is taken on good faith that the data was not fabricated (of course, patently absurd results would require more proof). One reason this is fine is because any result important enough to be replicated _will_ be replicated, and if other groups are unable to do so that will raise concern (which is what happened in this case). In very unique cases such as LIGO, where it's not feasible or even possible for other groups to replicate the results, more care has to be taken to ensure the authenticity of the results. In the case of LIGO, several of their recorded signals have been corroborated by radio-wave detection of the same events, which makes them more plausible.\n\nThe tl;dr is that a published article is not a stamp of truth, it's at best a stamp of rigor, but rigor is not infallible.",Physics

"Ok so I'll just regurgitate what I know. Plasmogamy = Fusion of protoplasm/the plasma walls. Syngamy = Fusion of gametes. Karyogamy = Fusion of nuclei. In paramecium two (iirc) haploid micro-nuclei get exchanged and then the paramecium detach from one another, then the nuclei fuse. In that instance the fusion of the paramecium would be Plasmogamy, then, later, when they detach and the nuclei fuse that would be Karyogamy.\n\nUsually Karyogamy follows after the plasmogamy. In some instances though, like some Basidiomycota Plasmogamy and Karyogamy happen at vastly different times. First the Hypha of two individuals fuse when they meet, and then, when the conditions are right the nuclei fuse and the mushrooms form their fruiting bodies to expel their spores.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I'm not very knowledgable about Myxomycota however (or slime molds) and would recommend checking out the subreddit for that, as it does exist and the people there are very much willing to answer those questions.

"""not influenced by internal or external stimuli"", how can anything do anything if it doesn't have a reason to?\n\nIf free will is being unfettered by things like instinct (internal stimuli) that drive me to eat when I'm hungry and avoid bodily harm (external stimuli perceived as ""danger""), then an actor with free will should be just as likely to step into traffic and die as not, with the randomness of a coin flip. I think your definition of free will is insufficient.\n\nIn AI and economics there is the concept of an agent with goals. A rational agent acts to achieve some goal (win the chess game, get the car to the destination) by choosing actions, or sequences of actions, based on their perceived utility towards achieving that goal. Things in the real world have a finite perception of the options they have and the consequences of their actions, and often even a limited conscious understanding of their own goals,  easily confusing the utility measured towards towards their final goals (??) with utility towards lesser goals instrumental towards final goals (reproduction, consuming calories in preparation for hard times, etc).\n\nMillions of years of evolution and a lifetime of social conditioning have been tweaking the way species and individuals perceive and weigh their options in different situations. I think the search for ""free will"" ultimately demands a distinction without a difference and uninteresting compared to studying biology, psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology, etc.\n\nThis is a very liberal arts degree take (as my psychology and sociology education ends at the 200 level in the New York state undergraduate system), but I like Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development as a starting point for modeling and qualifying different types of actors.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development\n\nHe distinguishes the person (often as stages of life from infancy to adulthood) who only makes choices to avoid negative stimuli (punishment, hunger), with a person who acts toward some perception of right and wrong, and from there distinguishes where they get their sense of right and wrong-- does their friend group or society dictate their morals or do they have their own moral system that they would listen to over the rules society provides.\n\nIt's very simplistic and self contradictory. Like Heath Ledger's Joker could be argued to be level 2 like a pleasure seeking child as well as he could be argued to be a transcendent level 6 with his own higher moral code. But I think it's a fun place to start.",Physics

"Well it kinda depends on geometry but likely what is happening is that, you need to lean the bike hard to the right to keep the contact patch under the offset center of gravity, and that lean angle combined with the fork's offset forces the wheel to steer right. Fork offset changes steer angle in a lean - if there were no offset on the fork, the wheel would just flop to the side when driving straight because with a slackened steering axis, the wheel is actually at it's highest point when pointed straight, and 90 degrees to the direction of travel is it's lowest point. Due to the castor effect, fork offset causes the wheel to point forward when the bike is upright, but also causes the fork to self-steer into a lean due to the offset from the steering axis. A fork with zero offset would tend to point out of a turn while leaning. \n\nTL;DR: Bag is heavy on one side. Lean other direction to balance center of gravity.

"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",Physics

"This is a new proposal, fresh on the arXiv today, from a group of U.S. particle physicists. The introduction is very readable and lays out the mission clearly:\n\n> We can now confidently claim that the “Standard Model” of particle physics (SM) is established. At the same time, we are more and more strongly persuaded that this SM is incomplete. [...] It is now common to describe the SM as an “effective” theory that should be derived from some more fundamental theory at higher energies. But we have almost no evidence on the properties of that theory.\n\n> Our successes have become a liability in reaching this goal. Scientists from other fields now have the impression that particle physics is a finished subject. They question our motivations to go on to explore still higher energies. The scale of an energy frontier collider is also challenging to the young people in our field. They need to see qualitatively new capabilities realized during their active scientific careers. [...] That is where the urgency lies.\n\n> [T]he entire C3 program could be sited in the United States. With the cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider and the end of Tevatron operations the US has largely abandoned construction of domestic accelerators at the energy frontier. C3 offers the opportunity to realize an affordable energy frontier facility in the US. This may be crucial to realize a Higgs factory in the near term, and it will also position the US to lead the drive to the next, higher energy stage of exploration.\n\nThe main innovation is that they propose to use _non_-superconducting cavities, which allow much higher accelerating fields, cooled to increase their quality factor. The resulting shorter length dramatically decreases the cost, to an estimated $4 billion, which is 80% to 90% less than other proposals. Of course, $4 billion is no small amount of money, but for perspective that's about equal to the monthly budget of the National Institutes of Health, a third of the cost of the James Webb Space Telescope, or 2% of the total cost of the space shuttle.",Physics

You would still need 0.1 uL. \n\nIf you diluted 1/100, they would be 1E7/uL, so you would need 1 uL.\n\n(Note those numbers are for spiking the whole 200 uL of cells at once. If that isn't what you want, you will need to do the numbers for your volumes.)\n\nTo dilute 1/100, you can do  that in one step, or do 1/10 twice. The math is the same. It's just up to you what volumes to handle.\n\nNote that what we are doing here is breaking things down to small steps. One thing at a time. Makes it easier to follow. And round numbers make it easier. Once you think you have a plan, give the actual numbers a final check. (And good to have someone there double-check.)\n\nDo you need to correct for the volume added?

In the real world, no-one wants heavy metal chemistry, because the 92 more stable elements can do so much, are safer to use, and much much cheaper. And also, they exist on a meaningful timescale.",Chemistry

"I can't get my head around potential energy, specifically gravitational potential energy but it applies to the other forces as well. If I throw an object in the air, it has a certain amount of kinetic energy but as it slows down, where does that energy go? what is the physical manifestation of that energy? Does the earth apply a force to the object through gravity and reduce in mass for example?",Physics

"I agree, but good luck getting the purchase approved though. Even if it's cheaper in the long run, you're more likely to get approval for purchasing 2 or 3 replacements a year.

"4D as in 3 spatial dimensions + 1 temporal dimension or 4D as in 4 spatial dimensions? Because the first case is quite simple, it would just appear to be a 3d object whose dimensions may vary with time. The second case would likely be a projection of a preexisting 3d representation of a 4d object (there are many such representations, you can look them up if you like). There is nothing we can do to accurately render a 4 (spatial) dimensional object in 3d, even with VR (since it caters to our 3d senses)",Physics

"This is true for stored fat but dietary fat can be turned into glucose by denuovolipogenesis and that can certainly be stored as glycogen. Whether or not the mechanism is active during ketosis, idk. Your brain still gets up to 30% of its energy from glucose even in deep ketosis so you need some glucose still. \n\nDenuovolipogenesis accounts for like >4% of dietary fat though so it’s not a major source.",Biology
