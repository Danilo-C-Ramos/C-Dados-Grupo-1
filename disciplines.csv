0,"A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \n\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes.",Biology

There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",Physics

209,"Hirsch isn't looking to ""recreate the plots exactly.""\n\nAnd, in any case, doing so is not actually scientifically important. If there is fakery, recreating fake plots from fake raw data *does not actually test scientific truth.* (I will assume you include supplemental instructions along with the data, because the original manuscript is usually space constrained so it actually cannot give enough information to get from raw data to plots: that is the hand-holding I mean).\n\nIn a philosophical sense, there is always some faith you are placing in the provider of data that it is really the data that the instruments provided. You can't eliminate that. Sharing data is more a measure of truthful behavior in a social, behavioral sense.\n\nI already distinguished that in some cases like observational sciences it can allow some additional science when it is taken generally without respect to the model being tested. That is the case in LIGO: you assume they are capturing actual strain in space-time, and sharing the data is then useful because it wasn't collected with any particular model of neutron stars or even general relativity. So if you have a competing model for such objects, you can use that data to figure out an alternative idea for what produced it.\n\nBut in a case like Dias, the data, even if truly collected from the apparatus, can't generally tell you, for example, whether the compound in the apparatus was prepared as the manuscript says, or whether the temperature and external fields were as the manuscript says. There are too many assumptions made before the data is actually collected.",Physics

This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there.

354,I‚Äôm struggling to understand what you mean,Physics
355,"Here‚Äôs a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \n\n‚Äú‚Äú>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn‚Äôt affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. ‚Äú\n\n[End of your quote. If you don‚Äôt feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there‚Äôs no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I‚Äôve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don‚Äôt actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I‚Äôve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I‚Äôm saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It‚Äôs one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you‚Äôre so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I‚Äôve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n‚Äú>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.‚Äù\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said ‚Äú[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got‚Äù and then you tell me to ‚Äúshut up‚Äù for saying that you said that ‚ÄúDAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.‚Äù I‚Äôm very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I‚Äôm this part where you quoted me I‚Äôm saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be feasible‚Äù this was meant to be synonymous with ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù rather than ‚Äúunfeasible,‚Äù then either you‚Äôve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I‚Äôm also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",Physics

You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against.  You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.  Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules.

With such examples as quantum beat phenomena, the quantum eraser, and certain two-photon interference phenomena, as discussed later in this book,\nit becomes necessary to think of the photon as a quantum mechanical entity whose basic physics is much deeper than the semiclassical theory plus vacuum fluctuation logic.‚Äù\nQuantum optics Scully and Zubairy page 20",Physics

Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.",Physics

579,"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years.

Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years. Which is still a lot more stable than their respective neighbors with half lives of some seconds. \nThe hunt is not over though!

Low to no light means trouble navigating/finding food/finding partners for reproduction.     It's also very cold, meaing that any and all reactions in the body will work much slower, meaning growth of organisms is generally expected to be slower.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow there are obviously adaptions for this: Filter feeding, bioluminescence, both for attracting partners and pray. A very good sense of smell, special proteins against the cold, generally slow metabolisms to deal with little amount of food etc.. But these are all highly specific, so much so that what can exist down in the deep is limited. Things with little to no bones, like cnidarians, ctenophores, cephalopods etc.. have an advantage because pressure affects these less.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm however no expert on this matter even in the slightest and going mostly off of what I have heard and can imagine the reasons to be. I do encourage you to look for some clues yourself, but in the end it boils down to extreme living conditions automatically meaning less animals to be found.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want a comparison for terrestrial environments: Environments with extreme salinity and very little water like deserts (one of the prominent plants here being Welwitschia mirabilis, a monotypic plant that can get over a thousand years old, with new invididuals only surviving in small periods of rain).

During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.) Hence why papers like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037026938390638X?via%3Dihub) establish _upper_ bounds on the vacuum energy of the axion field.",Physics

Sounds stupid, but I have come across a company with a different technology who just thought that they had to improve their tech and put in more energy scavenging to break even.\n\n2. They are only reconstituting carbon, whereas most fossil fuels are hydrocarbon. It could be that they are banking on the extra energy from the hydrogen part of the combustion. Unlikely, because the Carnot limit would probably still leave a power plant operating at a loss. \n\n3.  This is not aimed at power plants, but at things like cement factories which also produce CO2.

Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\n\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\n\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\n\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\n\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection",Biology

There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data.

966,"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology

Very low yield. Also tried tosylating and similar outcome. Did a reaction with PBr3 and got the primary alcohol selectively transformed but low yield and not sure if I'll have difficulty adding the amine there in the presence of a phenol. One of the major byproducts I've gotten when attempting to add amine is the elimination product to get a monosubstituted alkene so I've tried using different bases to deprotonate the DEA but doesn't seem to be helping. Maybe the DEA would be reactive enough on its own without additional base to promote substitution instead of elimination? Not sure.",Chemistry

Then reversing the time,  you find that the transformation time is swapped.\n\nMore concretely, let A to B transformation takes X time but B to A transformation takes Y time when played forward in time.  Now, if you see a recording and find that B changes to A in X time, you know that recording is played backward in time.  You have just broken time-symmetry since you can determine if the recording is played forward or backward in time. \n\nOf course, as others mentioned.  The overall system has to preserve CPT-symmetry.  In this case, when playing it backward in time, you do not reverse either the charge (C) or the parity (P).",Physics

That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",Chemistry

That's a problem for the explanation; skepticism is warranted.\n\nOthers have suggested a sticky-lid mechanism, which seems likely to adequately explain this.

That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nIt's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution.

Frequency is the most precise unit we can presently measure, so running out of experimental digits to agree with might not be the issue in this case.\n\nSince gravitation is responsible for this altered timing, GR can make a prediction for this alteration, and indeed according to the article apparently it does so well. However, it doesn't say to what precision the calculation is, though presumably it's tight enough to resolve the miniscule redshift...so possibly this is amongst the most accurate tests?

Imagine doing a reaction an the kilotonne scale. Lower selectivity means more waste and a 1% drop there is a lot of waste.\n\nTurnover number is another. How many molecules of reactant are converted to product in a second? Catalase is the one that comes to mind as the best here.\n\nStability is the last one that I'd consider. How long can the catalyst perform before it becomes inactive? Sometimes the catalyst can be regenerated like zeolites but you still want to be able to either stay in an active state or be stable enough to regenerate from an inactive state.,Chemistry

1489,"Hmm.  I would submit that many if not most highly-successful models in physics are or at least started out as exactly that:  hacks, as you've defined them here.  Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today ‚Äî these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics ‚Äî or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people ‚Äî humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension ‚Äî are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.

Also, since they have a product which captures carbon, people won't need to stop polluting.  This is just kicking the can down the road and allowing a literally extremely toxic system to continue existing.\n\n2.  There's an easier way out of this, but the solution is _political_, not technological.  It's really, really not hard to imagine a society where endless increasing production is not the _necessity_ to keep the 'economy' going.  This just requires completely retooling our political & economic system, since they are essentially the same thing at the moment.

1553,"*All* food proteins, with the exception of gelatin from rendered animal collagen, contain *all* of the essential amino acids. \n\nWhat differs is whether their proportions match requirements for human protein synthesis. Cereal grains tend to be limited in lysine. Legumes tend to be limited in methionine. One can still get a complete essential amino acid intake by eating enough of either, but combining these as part of daily menus mean that not much additional protein intake beyond the minimums is required.\n\nSoy is notable for being the legume with the highest methionine content. It's not a huge difference. Peas are methionine limited and have a DIAAS of around 80. Soy is methionine limited and has a DIAAS around 100. Eat 40 grams of soy protein, or 50 grams of pea protein, and you're getting the same amount of the limiting essential amino acid.

Then start solving from an equation that has that value in it. (Early on in chemistry there will be only one or two equations that you know with the target variable, so it's a safe starting point) \n\nNext go stepwise through that equation and for each variable see if it's given to you directly by the problem. \n\nFor the remaining variables not given directly in the problem, find another equation that has that variable in it, and substitute that into the original equation.\n\nthen repeat going step twice through that new addition equation identifying which variables are given to you in the problem. Repeat for all unknown variables. If you sub in an equation and pretty much everything in it is not given to the problem try a different equation.\n\nI recommend not putting any numbers in until the very end. Keep the whole thing as an alphabet soup. You'll get lots of partial credit that way even if you mess up. Then for the very last step, show each number that you sub in and solve for the value of the variable the problem is asking for.

The PhD experience is so huge that you can realistically omit all other job history and nobody will say anything.\n\nShould you feel you must include it or show a longer working period, a customer service job is maybe just 1-2 lines of year/location/title.  Different if are specifically targeting a job in customer service + chemical industry.  A chemical sales job I'd go 3-5 lines because working for a chemical company is relevant, especially the product, type of chemistry, size of team, your ops budget and any successes.  I do have jobs where I want to see evidence the chemist has a broad knowledge of supplier networks, but I also have jobs where I would ignore that skill.\n\nAnother aim is to remove any *negatives* from a resume.  If they job doesn't require customer service experience, remove it.  Maybe you worked at Dominos and the hiring manager hates that company for some random reason.

1650,"I would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the ground-effect region, and so extremely close to the ground, that viscous drag forces enter the system as well. \n\n(No particular order)\nEffect 1: as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed, the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance, so the exit-air‚Äôs volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry. \n\nEffect 2: as the distance diminishes, the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly. \n\nCombining 1 and 2, you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit. The fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed, but this acceleration takes work. And the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plate‚Äôs downward kinetic energy. Therefore the plate slows down (at least in part) from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid. \n\nEffect 3: when the plate gap gets quite small, there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the air‚Äôs acceleration along the escape path. The air‚Äôs inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise, and the plate‚Äôs downward motion is decelerated even stronger now. Now it‚Äôs on a more pronounced ‚Äúair cushion‚Äù but time is limited before it runs out. \n\nEffect 4: For very light and very large plate, there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate. It appears floating, initial downward speed is gone, but a small downward speed is still required for the air‚Äôs pressure to remain high. Now that the plate‚Äôs weight is almost balanced, the motion from here forward is now roughly constant. The plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime, where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap. \n\nEffect 5: now the plate may have had some forward momentum! Or otherwise, with the plate in the floating regime, air might realistically leave faster on one side, giving the plate a tilt. Now it ‚Äúslides downhill‚Äù on this inclined air cushion. \n\nEffect 6: there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely. The plate‚Äôs slow, constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this \n\nIn all, the total combination of these effects can make falling, light, large plates stop descending, start sliding forward, and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving.",Physics

We're limited with how far we can go there because the half lives start getting too short for neutron capture to occur before the target decomposes. There ultimately isn't enough incentive to design a whole new reactor to slightly increase the yields of heavier isotopes of these elements because we still most likely won't be able to push further past Fm.\n\nMost of our current synthetic chemistry starts to not work very effectively on a ¬µg scale which is why the state of the art is pretty much limited to Bk/Cf since Es and Fm are only available on sub-¬µg scales.

1882,"Disease is a big factor. New strains of viruses and bacteria appear (or change in frequency) every year, making pathogen-resistance alleles come and go as well, almost like yearly fashion trends.\n\nThere are planktonic animals that make resting stages (e.g. eggs) that sink to the bottom of the pond and can stay in suspended animations for several years. In [one classic study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06291), old resting stages of *Daphnia* (along with their pathogens) were dug out of the mud and reanimated. This is basically like using a time machine to hop back and forth and systematically cross-expose parasites and hosts from different time periods. One cool result was that the pathogens tended to be more able to infect *Daphnia* from the same year, showing that pathogens evolve to become especially good at infecting whatever genotypes are in the host population at the moment.\n\nWeather is another big factor. For species that reproduce fast, it can even change the population within a single year. There's a really cool study system of wild fruit flies in orchards in North America. The researchers working in the orchards have shown that allele frequencies change every year from spring to fall, as the weather becomes warmer and warmer, favoring genotypes that are good at living in warm conditions (the same alleles that are more common farther south, in fact). Then winter comes, and the population is ""reset"" as genotypes that are good at handling cold become favored instead. So it's easy to see how warm years and cold years would have a similar effect.",Biology

1932,"It's not a stupid question, just perhaps an uncomfortable one to consider.\n\nThe answer boils down to ""yes, but..."". Just as we have bred various animals for specific tasks, we could hypothetically breed ourselves for increased strength and durability, or for some other goal. If we can turn wild steppe horses into massive Clydesdales and speedy Arabians, or take grey wolves and turn them into mastiffs and chihuahuas, we can certainly do similar things to ourselves.\n\nThe thing is, though, such changes come with trade-offs. A growing body only has so many resources at its disposal, and sinking those resources into one organ or function takes them away from somewhere else. We humans dump a lot of resources into our huge brains, for example, at the cost of a lot of other things compared to other animals; it's just that our brains provide such a massive advantage that it's worth it.\n\nAnother thing to consider: I think it's in the final episode, but at some point Nolan tells Mark that Viltrumite genetics are so pure that Mark's basically fully-Viltrumite; Mark only inherited a few superficial genes from his human mother. That's not how things work; to a biologist, ""genetically pure"" actually means ""*super* inbred"". \n\nA lot of domestic animal breeds have health problems, especially pure-breds. Not only are pure-breds usually very inbred, but if they've been bred for specific purposes, they tend to be very good at that but worse at other things. If we started breeding humans specifically for strength and durability, or speed, or intelligence, or *whatever*, you're automatically limiting your potential gene-pool, and humans already have quite low genetic diversity compared to other species. Your super-strong humans are probably going to start developing other problems within a few generations, like heart defects or being more prone to cancer. Maybe your super man will be as swole as a gorilla, but he's going to look like a Hapsburg.",Biology

Also about how confident you are that there isn't anything else in solution that behaves like Cl- (IIRC F- can interfere with chloride ISEs, don't quote me on that though).\n\nSo ultimately, if you can make it yourself and are confident in the purity of KCl / DI water you're using, I don't see why not.

If we pick two points on the rope and imagine the tension we see the tension is much higher at the top as the rope is holding the mass of all the rope beneath it. If we look at a point at the bottom, the mass of rope applying tension is much less. Again, if we look at the forces applied to a single point on the rope we can see at the top the tension vector is very long in the negative direction in comparison to the horizontal force of the wind. The sum of those vectors faces almost completely down. As we continue to do so further down the rope we see the tension decreases and the ratio of that tension vector in comparison to the horizontal air force vector decreases and the total force vector points more in the direction of the horizontal force.",Physics

2024,"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",Physics

If we do find it, the relevant language will be invented then and there.\n\nIt is for something I plan to work on, but life outside of Earth is 100% fact, we cant argue against that.\n\n>It's true that we'd have to make up a lot of new taxonomy, though. Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\n\n>If, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet. So ""tree of life"" basically becomes a new taxonomic level above domain. Currently we have no need for such a taxonomic level, because it's a category with a single representative (Earth life).\n\nMy point is that humans dont share a common ancestor, we evolved from ourselves, but we have two forms, our ancestors (Very similar to primates, but not decended to them) and our pre ancestors ( our old form, in our old planet, we would have to scrap many things to presume How we lived and were, my hyphotesis is that we behaved like robotic psychics, we were telepaths, used the Power of our minds to do tasks and processses, constantly changing our environment. We probably didnt have emotions, didnt move, were giants, like towers, and I dont even know if we did procreate).\n\nAnd I even claim that our pre ancestor side is regenerating with time, this is why we dont look like animals anymore and became more rational.\n\n\nTaxonomy is a actually something much more complicated, in some cases, like us, you have to show the multiple Nature while maybe at the same time showing their percentages, it should be something like chemistry, where the nomenclatures are all complex and sophisticated.",Biology

There are students and professors who love being the lab so much that it becomes their life.  Their friends are at the lab, their passion is the lab, they can fit hobbies into or around the lab.  But it will vary hugely from group to group and even between individuals.\n\nBig change is more annual holidays than the US and healthcare changes dramatically.  But it's still mostly the same in academic labs all over the world.  Variable.\n\n> Should I just reach out to random ~~graduate students/~~ advisors...\n\nYes, that is entirely the whole process.\n\nCreate a short resume or 1/2 page bio and e-mail potential advisors with some flattery then ask if they have any opportunities in their group.  You should ideally have looked at their personal research page and be able to answer one or two questions about what they do.  Make the e-mail very targeted as all professors get spammed with generic ""Dear sir/madam, I am a PhD student from poor place can I please work for u?""\n\nIf the professor likes you, they can point you towards resources.  Many professors are seeking talented and interested students - pulling from a random pile of unknowns is risky for them.  You may have to wait for funding to be approved or a successful grant.  There are sometimes specific funding sources to bring in international students.\n\nCost of living, well, you are still a PhD student who doesn't earn much money.

2154,"IMO-->  Empathy is a multi-faceted problem.  I would relate it to the kind of computational power required to simulate our universe, with all of it's constantly changing and simultaneously interacting variables.  The more accurately you can create someone else's world in your mind, the deeper your empathetic understanding will be.  It would also require simulating any emotional feelings, separate from standard inputs like sight, sound, touch, taste, temperature, etc.  All environmental variables would need to be simultaneously processed, respective to their constant changes.  Empathy requires the kind of math quantum computers were built for.  Most of the same kinds of mental skills would be required when imagining a complex mechanical device in action, with all of it's moving parts, friction heat, outside influences, and any other variables.  For the same reasons it would also apply to complex chemical reactions or visualizing complex physics.  Or you can imagine choosing the most efficient route for a package in a large shipping company, with all of it's ever moving planes, trains, trucks, personnel, etc.  The variables are constantly changing, therefore, the package's route is ever changing.\nThis would be different, however, than someone who memorized fixed mathematical rules to solve a complex linear or singular type equation.  Therefore, if a multi-faceted intelligence is valued over a more focused linear type intelligence, then yes, it would require more intelligence to produce higher quality empathetic understandings.

I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire). You could maybe do a ketyl test if you have the reagents. If you have a spare O2 sensor, I would go ahead and replace the current one and see what happens.\n\nA few questions: did you turn off the gas circulation before opening the MeI, and did you purge thoroughly after it was re-sealed? MeI is going to absolutely wreck the box catalyst if you are not careful. The O2 sensor may also be sensitive to MeI - those sensors typically have a lifetime of 6 months - 2 years, but they have somewhat sensitive surfaces that can be poisoned by exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nFinal question: is the H2O also shooting up, or is it just the O2?

This is the exact same physical state as the football. The mass of the ball is distributed closest to the axis, so it is least likely to deviate from a spin.\n\nIf any force were to cause it to wobble, it would want to return to its its smallest moment of inertia at first, and this would be guarded by gyroscopic procession, which causes all movement parallel to the axis of rotation to occur processed 90 degrees forward along the direction of rotation. Any outside force, instead of spinning the ball, would just cause it to wobble.\n\nI hope this helps.",Physics

The holograms can also be entirely generated by a computer, like the ones shown here.\n\nThe standard recording material for the holographic film is a silver halide emulsion. Spatial light modulators, which are based on a LCD, can be used for creating real-time varying holograms. Finally, with the advent of nanofabrication techniques, today we can also create metasurfaces to do the task and mold optical wavefronts into almost any arbitrary profile over several wavelengths.\n\nThis technique can be used as well for displaying an arbitrary 3D object, but for a more quality reconstruction, a bit more complex setup is going to be required, for example, by performing oblique illumination on the holographic film.\n\n[The source code I implemented for propagating the wavefront and creating the holograms can be found here.](https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Diffraction-Simulations--Angular-Spectrum-Method)\n\nHappy Halloween to everyone üéÉ",Physics

This makes sense because space is not a 100% true vacuum, there are still some particles, but they are so sparse that the pressure is effectively 0.  Since space is infinitely more massive than water in the tube, it will seem like a unidirectional force and thus 'free energy', even though the system is trying just as hard to suck the sparse particles in as to push water up.

For the record, I am interested in Eth Zurich, schools in Germany and the UK, and am passionate about organic chemistry and multi-step synthesis. I have been in industry for a few years after obtaining my master's, however I have no publications, at least, the material may not be published for a few more years (my former advisor is slow to publish and has a record of taking 5 years after graduation to publish a work). I am curious if anyone has ever made that leap from the States to Europeans schools. I have seen a number of fantastic professors that have interesting research that I would love to apply to be a PhD student in their labs, however I am unsure of the tenability, especially in terms of pre-earmarked budget, cost of living, expenses, resident requirements, resident requirements/fees, taxes, and even covid regulations. I am also unsure of what work culture is like in Europe. I have heard hear-say that Germany and Switzerland have student unions to push back on advisors and their requirements for PhD students to work 50-80 hours a week; that the work life balance for PhD candidates is actually a lot better than in the US. That sounds like a dream and another motivating factor that makes me interested.  \n  \nHas anyone made that leap? If so, would you care to comment?

If you genuinely like and are good at chemistry, you memorize a few things and then problem solve the rest.  Look into organic chemistry.  It‚Äôs very puzzle-like.

It‚Äôs much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, it‚Äôs much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out it‚Äôs not working to figuring out why it‚Äôs not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, there‚Äôs almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesn‚Äôt work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.

2433,"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don‚Äôt want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried ‚Äúsalt bridges‚Äù where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to ‚Äúbend‚Äù the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains ‚Äúzip up‚Äù very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that‚Äôs going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I‚Äôve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher‚Äôs hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",Biology

There's plenty of research from a variety of academic fields that supports claims of this sort.\n\nNeuroscientists, (bio)physicists, and mathematicians can get along well enough to create a healthy discursive space, but when you add philosophers (or even worse, psychonauts...or the worst: psychonaut philosophers) into the mix, the company grows cold.

Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",Biology

2627,"> using vinegar to clean greasy ovens and microwaves\n\nIt's a mild cleaning option.  Perfect for some uses - too slow for others.\n\nThe grease in your oven is mostly food oils.  So it's a mix of triglycerides and burnt carbon deposits, not what you may think of as ""oil"".\n\nThe acetic acid in vinegar is in the neutral or non-ionic form.  Because it's neutral and almost hydrophobic, that allows it to penetrate through the grease to the substrate and then start to swell the grease layer from underneath.  Already that means you lifting the grease away from the surface. \n\nCompare that to a caustic cleaner which is trying to dissolve the grease layer from the top down, almost like sandpapering a surface.  The vinegar penetrating and lifting can allow you to mechanically scrape up chunks instead of dealing with a corrosive mess of liquid, similar to a paint stripper.\n\nDropping the pH will protonate any fatty acids and triglyerides from their ionic form into a neutral non-ionic form.  That also helps break up the grease layer. \n\nCommercial oven cleaner is often a mix of caustic soda and an organic amine penetrating chemical.  Best of both worlds, it penetrates to lift from the surface, plus its cuastic to start dissolving from the top down.\n\nDistilled white vinegar is fantastic at polishing mirrors, glass, counter tops and handrails because it doesn't leave any residue.  You wet a microfibre cloth and it will remove any finger prints.",Chemistry

And since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction (or a component with a weak interaction) it has very weird consequences with how particles gain mass.\n\nIn principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and they'd just add up to the physical mass that we observe. And there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the Lagrangian (the Lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff). You just write m \* psibar \* psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particle's mass. But because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side, such a term is forbidden. Peter Higgs, and others, realized the solution to this: let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be non-zero everywhere. This gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way, but also respects the left handedness of particles. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality works.\n\nWith neutrinos its even weirder, but I'm getting pretty far off point.",Physics

I have very light blue eyes and I'm miserable in the sun, but I can have a kid just fine and pass on that trait. If blue eyed people were so inhibited by their blue eyes, we'd die out before we were able to reproduce, but it's just one of those things that has a negligible impact on reproduction.\n\nSo, why do soybeans have more proteins? A bean at one point in time developed a mutation in their DNA and they generate more amino acids and it didn't inhibit their ability to reproduce, or maybe it actually improved their ability to reproduce or adapt to environments, and that's probably cutting edge soybeanology, might be a good topic for a paper.

3123,"Any virus will be under selection for higher transmissibility / infectivity. Not because of any ""want"", natural selection doesn't require desires. Most viruses have relatively high mutation rates, and while the vast majority of these mutations will be harmful to viral replication, some may improve transmission. Thanks to high replication rates in hosts (ofther factors being equal), any variants with higher transmissibility will quickly come to dominate the viral population.\n\nUntil recent decades, it was believed that viruses were under selection for *less* virulence (which FYI, means ""disease severity or lethality""), because a virus that rapidly kills or incapacitates its hosts will encounter fewer hosts to infect. For example the 1918 H1N1 influenza was remarkable for being rapidly lethal in susceptible hosts, with some infected with severe disease going from asymptomatic to dead in under a day. This actually hindered its spread, as the infected had only a very brief window of time to spread the disease. It perhaps should come as no surprise that modern relatives of H1N1 are far less virulent.\n\nHowever, there are some important exceptions. If a virus is normally transmitted in a pre-symptomatic stage of infection, there will be little selection for less virulence. For transmission, it wont matter much if all infected drop dead if there are many days in which hosts are infections and in contact with others.\n\nAnd if a virus relies on the same mechanism for both transmissibility and virulence, then the positive selection for transmissibility can entail some selection for higher virulence. For example, the binding affinity of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein for host ACE receptors has effects both on lowering the effective infectious dose / inoculum (thus increasing  transmissibility), as well as increasing the rate of viral replication within hosts, plausibly leading to viral replication outpacing host immune response. The Delta variant has nearly doubled transmissibility compared to wild type, and somewhat higher virulence in some host age groups. Here, its possible that the expected selection for higher transmissibility is also bringing some selection for higher virulence.",Biology

3157,"I think the word you're looking for is altruism, and act of compassion towards another unrelated organism with little to no regard for the risk to oneself or compensation of such an act. In humans it is evident, although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that, on a subconscious level, it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others, that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins, a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you don't know, which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals. We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parent-offspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species. The same can be said for cetaceans, which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution. Although they may not be aware, or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk (although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites, at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species), their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures (humans, seals, other whales) based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress. Again, the payoff is positive endorphins rather than, let's say, the abstract idea of ""I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine"". I'm not sure this meta study has been done, but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species, the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species, which simply means the more social an animal is, the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards non-related organisms. But again, there is a reward whether you're aware of it or not, that being positive endorphins. One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind, and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the ""selfless"" nature of putting yourself at risk for others.

3181,"Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor or researcher, and I haven't read anything about ibuprofen vs. COVID vaccines, but I'll take a stab at it:\n\nInflammation (aches, soreness) is part of the human body's immune response to infection or vaccines. Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory, and thus might work to lessen the inflammation triggered by the vaccine (maybe, I dunno for sure).\n\nIbuprofen wears off fairly quick, so any anti-inflammatory action should be short-lived. Ideally. But taking more ibuprofen is something to be wary of. \n\nDid you completely negate the vaccine with one dose of ibuprofen? Unlikely (but I don't know for sure). The immune response consists of more than just inflammation (white blood cell recruitment, memory-cell generation) that takes a while to generate maximum protection (two weeks for full effect). My **guess** is taking ibuprofen for one out of fourteen days wouldn't make much difference. \n\nIf someone wants to correct me, and/or link to studies of vaccines and ibuprofen, please feel free.",Biology

3197,">I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent ‚Äî after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.  Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.  It may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated ""models""/systems/frameworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a ""hacky"" or ad-hoc way from our human perspective.\n\nPlaying ""god"" for a minute, one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as ""well we slapped this idea together with these two, and then glued it all together using *this* one, and by golly would you look at that: it can sustain intelligent life! who'da thunk it?""\n\nAs much as I *abhor* the anthropic principle and consider it a non-explanation for any phenomenon in general, I'll admit it is still entirely possible (perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true) that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery. :p\n\nAnyhow, cheers and thanks for the interesting convo! :)",Physics

3220,"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology

That will be the Limit of Detection (LOD) which is the smallest amount of acetic acid you can detect.\n\nSecond is repeatability.  Take a big bottle of any type of acorbic acid at any concentration (but relevant to your experiment is best).  Homogenize it.  Split it into 10 equal or at least known masses.  Do the titration on those 10 samples and make a results table (include all results, even outliers).  Determine the standard deviation.

It is generally considered to be a bad argument because the implicit (unstated) primary premise ""What is natural is good"" is typically irrelevant, having no cogent meaning in practice, or is an opinion instead of a fact. In some philosophical frameworks where natural and good are clearly defined within a specific context, the appeal to nature might be valid and cogent.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",Chemistry

The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> ‚Ä¶According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world.

Some issues to consider: how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome (not splitting important genes); ensuring regular but not too active transcription; would it lead to a sort of ""tolerance"" to the antigen, causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen.

3569,"Great question!  It does in fact take more power to maintain a constant acceleration at increasing speed.   You can manipulate basic equations around to come up with P = F x V which clearly jibes perfectly with your observation that KE is exponentially increasing with constant acceleration.   So how do you explain a rocket, is it getting free energy (or free power) from a constant thrust force?  The answer is no of course, so what‚Äôs actually happening?   At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because it‚Äôs velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.   Keep in mind we‚Äôre not doing relativity here, so from a stationary vantage point, with constant rocket acceleration you see each progressive bit of rocket exhaust coming out with a slower and slower absolute downward velocity.  It has less and less power going into it, which cancels with the rocket‚Äôs increasing power given by F x V.",Physics

3579,"Part answer to your question: there's so much chemistry we don't know of the first 92 elements. Elements which are actually pretty stable, can be made and quantified and studied far more easily.\n\nThe biggest issue with heavy elements is radioactivity and rarity. Rarity makes them expensive. Radioactivity makes them difficult to use from a chemistry perspective. If you make an Es complex, it will only stay an Es complex for as long as the isotope exists. When that's on the order of seconds, microseconds etc, it's basically impossible to isolate it as a compound.\n\nIf you cannot isolate it as a compound, it's difficult to study.\n\nAnd there's the more practical reason, if you cannot isolate it, can you really call it a ""useful"" product.\n\nThinking of the economics of chemistry, what industrial process wants to use a very rare, very expensive element that decays over a matter of seconds in their chemical process.\n\nSo the applications aren't there, so the funding isn't there, so chemists don't study it.\n\nPhysicists on the other hand love heavy elements, because they care about fundamental processes. A chemist cares a lot more about ""what can I do with it"", and for heavy metals, the answer is, not a lot.",Chemistry

Instead of accepting flying less often, we are willing to spend twice as much ready-to-use electricity as is equivalent to the energy used in a flight to ""store energy"" as a CO2 deficit to fill later. But ok: if flights start to be priced including the cost of energy for CO2 recovery from high altitudes, maybe prices will become realistic and people will fly less anyway.\n\nBut for airplanes it is not just that: they deposit the CO2 at high altitudes, where it remains for a longer time with a multiplied warming effect of a ton at ground level [by a factor of 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231020305689?via%3Dihub \n).

This term is, in fact, hard to calculate and depends on things that we can't yet probe. But it doesn't matter because there's another contribution from GR. This one is an integration constant. That is, it is a free parameter not predicted by anything. So the observed number is the number from QFT plus the number from GR. You can see that it doesn't matter what the QFT number is since you can get to any possible observed number by changing the number from GR to match.\n\nNow someone familiar with this topic knows that I have swept a big elephant under the rug. The numbers in question are a bit silly. The number from QFT seems to be something in the range of 10^120 times the measured value. So the GR number has to be 1-10^120 in the same units. Now, there's no problem with it being negative, but some physicists are surprised that these two seemingly unconnected areas of physics have two numbers that are so closely related.

You could argue that CO2 capture technology and companies are bad because they might enable fossil fuel use rather than switching over to renewables, so that the government wouldn‚Äôt pass legislation that reduced fossil fuel consumption. On a practical level, this type of argument is a reasonable concern, and I think that it‚Äôs important to keep in the public discourse around carbon capture. At the same time, direct air capture had the potential to be so valuable in terms of removing historic CO2 emissions that I don‚Äôt think we should just ignore it because of its potential to be misused. Another nice side effect of CO2 capture technology is that many of the materials useful for carbon capture are similar to materials used to capture pollutants or toxic elements both from gas streams and water, and these types of small molecule adsorbents might prove to be very good for human and environmental health.",Physics

3817,"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology

3931,"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled.

So, while it seems quite implausible, the argument may go that it is at least *possible* this doesn't prove viruses indicate an earlier origins of the twenty amino acids than LUCA. But it turns out that LUCAs own genome is filled with viruses that used the standard twenty amino acids. So LUCAs own virome helps confirm an earlier origins of the twenty.

4007,"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology

4030,"Agreed on false equivalence; I am not advocating MOND, or suggesting that it's a superior alternative to fit observational evidence -  we indeed have sufficient models for this. What I am suggesting however is that the largest technical breakthroughs in a theory tend to be ""hacks"" in the sense that, without a broader framework, they stitch together potentially disparate mathematical techniques in order to parsimoniously explain observations. This *usually* does not produce a well-rounded, coherent theory with a multitude of new predictions that fits neatly into all observed models (for a converse example, see general relativity, which did this perfectly). \n\nA solution to the horizon problem which I *wouldn't* consider ""hack-ish"" is one that has some kind of underlying conceptual impetus for *why* another ad-hoc scalar quantum field is a sensible addition to our universal framework, akin to *why* space-time is a sensible view of the universe. This is admittedly phiosophical, and I am not suggesting that inflaton fields or the higgs boson are bad physics - obviously they are far from it. Instead I am suggesting that these models hint at a deeper narrative we haven't grasped and that is reflected in their simplicity and disjointedness.",Physics

4067,"My lab was not the most smelly lab in the world. We did not make any iffy 'fine' organic synthesis. Just a bunch of chemicals, and nothing really exotic.\n\nWe had piperidine, and tetrahydropyrimidine, both smelled somewhere on the bad side of the spectrum. Can't speak much about thiophenol - it was contained safely in a well-corked vial with several layers of polyetylene zip-bags, inside a glass bottle, and all in the fridge at +3 celsius. Whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soon.\n\nOxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell - methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-isobutyl ketone, 2-hexanone (methyl-butyl ketone). Furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane (however the last one is borderline pleasant). Monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and bad.\n\nDimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted (somewhat 0.1% mass in propane). Dibuthylsulphide, on another hand, we had as a pure substance - and it is not pleasant at all, just believe me.\n\nBut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct (or, rather, residue). A greedy client hired us to determine what good - if any - contain his residues. It were residuals from olefine production, and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly. He basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit. Lighter products contained mostly butadienes (from which the 1,2-butadiene was the major one, defying thermodynamics), and the rest was a cocktail from hell - butyne-1, butyne-2, vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization. (I learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization - but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion. Thankfully, we did not learned that from first-hand experience!). \n\nHeavier fraction was not any better. We analyzed it with the method ASTM D 6730 (with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable, bad-looking, skunk-smelling devil mixtures). Oh dear. The majority, turns out, was styrene - upto 30%, and it by itself is not the best thing to work - not only it smells horribly, it also may be referred as a liquified cancer.  The rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation, partially polymerized, partially oxidated, and believe me, the entire chromatogram was something to see - and to stick labels to various peaks. The test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds - we found them all (discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table), but we also had several dozens which we can't stick a label to. I still believe there were some compounds still unknown to humanity.",Chemistry

I feel like intelligence may be impossible to quantify with the limited information that we can gather about someone. For example, Nickola Tesla was an ""intelligent"" individual but he was also delusional and had problems forming relationships which suggests that he had a low emotional intelligence. Therefore I would say Tesla was in fact of average intelligence, even though he was a very noteworthy individual who advanced various fields of science. Perhaps intelligence can be defined by one's contributions to society, but even that leaves a lot to be desired. Can anyone recommend a book about what intelligence actually is?

Now, the further Electromagnetic waves travel, the higher the redshift is measured with an ""infinite redshift"" at the event horizon of our observable universe. \n\nDoes that mean the wavelength of those photons approach 0 and wouldn't that also mean, that energy density decreases with time and distance , leading to the curvature of spacetime to ""flatten"", but since energy is always conserved, wouldn't that also mean that space seemingly increases? Like straightening a rope with wrinkles leading to longer length. And would that imply that  the cosmic redshift is not a result of expanding space, but the opposite?\n\nBut my most important question is, at what point did I start to merely speculate and let the bs flow?",Physics
4221,"As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved. You might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a PTFE stirbar on a hotplate. In the plant, it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer. All of the changes you make to scale up- more powerful mixers, bigger pumps, larger diameter pipes and hoses, can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale. A big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact, particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets, has the potential to leach into your product, or catalyze degradation, or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab.",Chemistry

4506,"I have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system. I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end.",Physics

The pressure into the wall creates static friction with the wheels (point of contact of a moving tire is stationary) which provides an upwards force against gravity. The wall is also slanted, so the wall itself provides some force upward on the car due to gravity, adding even more to the friction force.  \n\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/forces-newtons-laws/inclined-planes-friction/v/static-and-kinetic-friction-example  \n\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/centripetal-force-and-gravitation/centripetal-forces/a/what-is-centripetal-force",Physics

4676,"I'm not sure about porcelain, but some glass materials commonly referred to as ""crystals"" used in plates or cups contain lead ""impurities"" that that impart certain structural defects in the material to have different properties (ex: a coloured tint - modify hardness - make the material more hazy, etc..). This lead trapped inside the SiO2 or B if you have borosilicate doesn't come out of the lattice as easily, because to the best of my knowledge it replaces a Si atom. Although, depending on the pH of what you consume you might leach some Pb into your meal, so I would say it all depends. If you leach some of the Pb on the surface of the material, then you know that in the future uses the Pb that is deeper in the material won't come out as easily, hence the recommendation of washing these types of crystals before using.",Chemistry

In the last line of the derivation, they assume the pressures outside the tank and at the top of the fluid column are both atmospheric, but that's not the case here. So what you want is the second-to-last equation, which contains both the contributions from the height of the tank, and from the pressure difference.\n\nAnd you can see how that varies as you change the position of the hole in the tank. If the pressure difference between inside and outside is dominant, then moving the hole up or down will have little effect on the flow velocity, and the velocity will be proportional to the square root of the pressure difference.",Physics

There's not freedom to make up new nonsense. The usage of ""dark sector of invisible particles"" means something specific to physicists. A term like ""dark"" often means ""not interacting with light"" -- e.g. if you're not in the light you're in the dark. It's not dark in the ""black magic"" sense. ""Sector"" often refers to some subset of matter fields and their coupling to some other subset of force carrying fields and the ""group representations"" that describe their relations.

Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection, just in time to pick it up again the next winter.  This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.  Fourth would be you're immune system is compromised, perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immuno-suppressant or had viral infection, like measles, which wipes out your immune memory.",Biology

I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills. Statistically speaking, big finance and big tech are where STEM majors go if they don't want to work in STEM but want to make the most money, which is why I keep mentioning those two fields.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics

4845,"It depends on the depth to which you want to dive. \n\nTo give the basic gestalt: \n\nLight enters through the air into your cornea, through the pupil and onto the retina surface of the eye. \n\nTwo types of receptors in retinal tissue, called rods and cones, sense the light and convert them into physiological electricity in the form of an action potential. \n\nThese action potentials travel through fibers that travel back to the brain via the optic nerve. \n\nDepending on the location within the eye orbit, the fibers have a different pathway to the brain. \n\nThe fibers located in the retina on the side of your nose cross over just after entering the skull, at the optic chiasm. \n\nThis allows the left side of your vision to be stored on the right side of your brain, and your right side vision to be on the left side of the brain.  (the brain has a thing for crossing over like this).\n\nFrom here, the fibers travel to the thalamus, which further divides them by where they originated in the retina. \n\nFrom the thalamus, the fibers travel to specific parts of the occipital cortex, depending on whether they originated in the superior part of retina, or the inferior part of the retina. \n\nThese fibers travel to distinct locations in the occipital cortex. \n\nThe brain processes these impulses and produces your perception of your surroundings. \n\nObviously, great amounts of time can be explaining the nuances of vision.",Biology

4977,"It‚Äôs unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didn‚Äôt even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earth‚Äôs temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. I‚Äôm not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely weren‚Äôt able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldn‚Äôt have replaced oil. It also wasn‚Äôt merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you don‚Äôt make a compelling case for why we shouldn‚Äôt try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.",Physics

Learn what an orbital is and all these things. From there there are some very important principles like electronegativity which will lead you towards reactivity. Then learn what a chemical bond is and why it is formed, what types of bonds there are but also rules about how many bonds which element tends to form and why / tendenc to give awy / take up electrons (noble gas configuration). If you don‚Äòt understand these things you won‚Äòt really understand chemistry but rather be learning facts. \n\nNow if you know all that stuff or once you‚Äòve learned that, start with basic things like acid-base chemistry and redox chemistry. They are very basic principles and maybe not the most interesting but as you learn more you will notice that you will encounter them quite often. And from there just see what you‚Äòre interested in and go for that.\n\nI guess organic chemistry might be a good start to understand some stuff that happens in nature and you can go into biochemistry from there if that seems interesting to you. \nJust be aware that if you want to check out organic chemistry depending on where you learn it from there might be a ton of reactions that are nice and cool but only relevant for synthesis and not for the sort of understanding you seem to be interested in.\n\nGenerally there are some good videos starting from the very basics on youtube if that‚Äòs something you like.",Chemistry

A good CV and cover letter is an art, ideally you tailor each one to the job you are applying for.\n\nHiring managers can easily filter people out by who's paid attention when sending out CVs, the less generic the better, it's all about being memorable.\n\nMy advice, pick about 8 jobs you actually like, not just ""I'm applying because I need a job and have skills in chem"". Put the time and effort in to rewrite your CV, making sure to include key words listed on the job posting. Make sure to emphasise (key skill they are looking for) from X experience under the relevant experience. So before they call you to interview they don't have to spend any time thinking about whether your experience is relevant. Assume that the hiring manager is overworked. When you are done, you have EXACTLY 1 MINUTE to read your CV and decide whether you are a good candidate for the role. Best thing you can do is give the selection criteria to a friend and time how quickly they can tick off the key things the hiring people are looking for. (This is a true anecdote from a friend who does hiring for their company). \n\nMost people will filter you out at selection if you don't meet their entry criteria.

So it's better to at least use the right words so people can connect what they're reading here with what they've read and heard elsewhere. And it's not like oscillations is a unfamiliar word.\n\nThe fact that neutrinos oscillate implies that there are almost certainly sterile neutrinos; the presence of a 1 eV sterile or not does not change that. And sure, leptogenesis could be the answer to BAU, but nothing that any neutrino experiment can measure can tell us one way or another.\n\nYour points are well taken though.",Physics

In my professional life, I spent a lot of my time supporting students who were in the same place as you are now, so I can appreciate your concerns.\n\nStudying at University is a big change from school, so you may well find University challenging initially. That‚Äôs completely normal. You say you study hard, and I‚Äôm sure you do, but perhaps you need to rethink <how> you study. Do you just read through stuff repeatedly? Do you work through practice examples? If you have to do tests, do you work through practice tests? If you have to do essays, do you do practice essays? If you read through stuff, don‚Äôt just read it. It‚Äôs better to make lists of the main points that the book / website / resource is making, for example.

In the UK, most universities would run study skills sessions for students, particularly in their first year: I don‚Äôt know if sessions like that are available in your institution. If there are, it might be helpful if you took part. How approachable are your tutors? It might also be worth speaking with them and asking their advice.\n\nA very big change to your programme of study needs careful consideration.

5351,"Simply put, inertia is the tendency of an object to keep doing what it's doing. Newton's first law of motion is also called the law of inertia commonly said as ""an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside unbalanced force."" In classical mechanics, gravity is just another force so if the gravitational force isn't balanced out by some other force then the object will accelerate according to Newton's second law.\n\nYou can also think of inertia as related to mass. It is harder to slow down a train moving at 50 m/s than it is to slow down a ball of paper moving at 50 m/s. And an object moving 1000 km/s in deep space (i.e. away from the influence of other objects' gravity) will continue to move 1000 km/s in the same direction until something changes that. \n\nPhysicists sometimes distinguish between inertial mass and gravitational mass though experimentally they've always been measured to be the same thing. In this case, inertial mass is the mass you see in Newton's second law when written as F=ma and gravitational mass creating the gravitational potential in the equation U = -Gm/r. Inertial mass would relate a force on an object to its overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines how much gravity an object has. Though again as far as we can tell they're the same.\n\nInertia also increases without bound as you push an object closer and closer to the speed of light. In other words, it gets harder and harder to speed up an object as you push it closer and closer to the speed of light.\n\nA final note on inertia there's also rotational inertia, which is the rotational analog of mass. Something with a higher moment of inertia is both harder to start spinning and harder to stop spinning. Moment of inertia (the official name for rotational inertia) depends not only on the mass of the object but also the distribution of mass away from the axis of rotation. A simple demonstration to see this is to take a meterstick and twirl it around its center vs trying to twirl it with the same force about one end. It's a lot harder to sping around one end because the mass is on average further away from the axis of rotation.",Physics
5352,"Try ether with acetonitrile! Pentane and acetonitrile aren‚Äôt miscible. Generally, when choosing a solvent system, ensure they are miscible; there are plenty of miscibility charts available online. \nAlso it‚Äôs easier imo if you add the anti solvent to the scintillation vial before you add the dram (smaller) vial to it. And a final tip for this technique would be to avoid disturbing the vial while waiting for it to crystallize. \nThere are other techniques one can try too. You can cool a saturated solution or, as someone mentioned, carefully layer a solvent and anti-solvent (and, if you wish, cool it as well). And in case nobody has explicitly defined it, an antisolvent is a solvent that your compound isn‚Äôt soluble in. \nFinally make sure to give your crystals lots of encouragement; they need it to grow! :)",Chemistry

5415,"The answer to that is kind of complicated, I‚Äôm no expert but I‚Äôll do my best to explain. A ceramic is pretty much a 3-dimensional matrix material arranged in a graphitic-type structure. It is generally made of silica and/or carbon mostly but there are plenty of other things that could be inside - mostly inorganic stuff like metals. They have characteristics like no glass transition temperature (which can kind of be thought of as a melting temperature in a layman sense), brittleness (because the chemical structure is highly croslinked and there arent many ways for the molecule to move and deflect energy, so it will simply break instead), heat resistance, and chemical/corrosion resistance. Ceramics can be made in many different ways, but my favorite type of ceramics are polymer-derived ceramics. In this method, you can take a silica based polymer and you basically just heat it up. At first the polymer crosslinks into a 3d shape, locking the shape in place. Then it pyrolyzes, where the less stable molecular structures are broken apart and volatilize out of the material. At high temperatures (like 1300 C) the bonds between the atoms are breaking chaotically and rearranging, and you end up with these carbon-rich domains which are basically graphite (this process is called graphitization) and silica rich domains. There are ways you can control the morphology to dramatically improve certain mechanical properties, but that gets into some complicated stuff.\n\nOh, and Ill add that a cool thing about polymer derived ceramics is that you can 3d print them, which is SUPER valuable for making intricate geometries like rocket engine components.",Chemistry

It occurs after conjugation in some organisms, but conjugation is not necessary for plasmogamy, most organisms release spores or gametes into the environment therefore conjugation is mostly not required.\nKaryogamy is the fusion of the nucleus. In some organism karyogamy is quite delayed after plasmogamy such as in certain kinds of fungi.\nI hope this helps, you will get a much clearer idea of these if you choose to take biology in higher classes.

5525,"Short answer stick to cs and there are plenty of cs jobs in healthcare, unless you specifically want to go MD. \n\nChemistry or especiallh biology is, unfortunately still largely a black box and there's little logic behind any of them. There are, but ask around and most research got the result first then try to explain the logic behind it. The most math intensive thing in benchtop chemistry or biology is deriving ratios for buffer and REPEATING it many times. On top of that bio majors produces the most amount of graduates so you will be competing with these many fuckers for these kind of jobs. \n\n\nThe most mathy Chem class is, of course physical chem and unfortunately it's not there to guide chemical reaction designs yet. It's close I would assume but not there. People would rather swing up a round bottom flask in one hour than computationally investigate a reaction for two days. There's no doubt in silico drug design is a thing but it's not typically something you touch in undergrad, for reference my undergrad at gatech back in 2014 spent one semester of pchem in a 200 ppl class of quant Chem which I can safely say as someone got an A with 60% exam scores, nobody got what the heck was going on. Another semester is wasted in thermodynamics which became absolutely useless. \n\nBiology is even worse in terms of memorization. Ive done 300 level biochemistry and had became a ta in that course involuntarily in grad school and it's all about memorization of stupid cycles that nobody cares. At least you'd imagine they'd teach you how that cycle is logically discovered, but fuck no.\n\nAlso be warned a typical Chem or bio graduate has nothing to do with healthcare. The closest healthcare job you can get with a chem bs is some guy running hplc in hospitals, and for biology I can't see any. If you like drugs that much, at least try computational drug design. Synthetic chem is arguably an easy way to get into drug design but I don't see it fitting you at all, just find the synthetic Chem labs in your school and talk to the grad kids what they do.

Another is that not all viruses are remembered equally.  Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection, just in time to pick it up again the next winter.  This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.  Fourth would be you're immune system is compromised, perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immuno-suppressant or had viral infection, like measles, which wipes out your immune memory.",Biology

The bigger the dish, the more energy it can redirect.\n\nIn reverse, a parabolic reflector can also create a ‚Äúbeam‚Äù of sound from a point source. This is not amplification, but it does optimise the energy that is there in a particular direction.\n\nAnother aspect is the efficiency of acoustic coupling. A vibrating membrane might have a certain power, but if it‚Äôs coupled poorly to the air, it won‚Äôt produce much sound. Certain shapes can vastly improve this efficiency. It does not ‚Äúamplify‚Äù, but it does make sure that what energy is there is transferred to the air efficiently. This is the purpose of horns such as on acoustic gramophone players, brass musical instruments, PA speakers, etc. The best shape is an exponential horn that forms a smooth impedance match between the original source of vibration and the air. Horns work either way around - as a receiver, the human ear is somewhat like a horn; many animals have very obviously horn-shaped ears which acts as a combined horn + parabolic reflector.\n\nby Graham Cox, BSc (hons) from University of East Anglia (1993)",Physics

5785,"I'm sure someone will write on a way cleaner way since i'm going from memory.  \nAll of them come from the 3 dimensional wave function, do note that the 3d z\^2 may also be written as 3d z\^2 - r\^2 (after all, you'll probably be solving it in spherical coordinates and later returning to cartesian coordinates). If you really want to know more specific details such as where do each wave function comes from and how to write them you'll have to look on a quantum mechanics books, the expressions can get quite extensive.   \nWith that in mind, the squares can be easilly associated with the probability densities (squared wave function), since that is what you'll be seeing the orbital plots, and with some (really large) degree of freedom of speech, try to imagine the xy, xz, zy as solutions where the variables are correlated, justifying the fact that is never purely in the x or y (and so on) axis. For the x\^2 - y\^2 think of them as a linear combination of non-correlated variables to form the general solution, thus the highest probability wont be on a region where the (x\^2 , y\^2) combination is at it's maximum but where either (x\^2 , 0) or (0, y\^2) is being maximized.   \nThe biggest problem with this analogy comes from the z\^2 - r\^2 one, here you'll need to have some revolution solids in mind, since it's quite easy to see that the density regions are separated by a 3-dimensional cone instead of a traditional cartesian axis, that's where the r\^2 may help to visualize its formation. Try plotting a surface such as z\^2 - x\^2 - y\^2 and note that the 3d z\^2 solution lies inside the cone and around it.   \nHowever, do realize, this is just an (way) overly simplified justification, you'll need to check the wavefunction solution for each case to really get a picture of whats going on behind the scene and it's now that hard to find a table of such solutions. I'm pretty sure you'll be able to check some of the formal definitions on a book such as Quantum Chemistry by Levine, they come mostly from working the Hydrogen Atom but there's plenty of nuances on its treatment and **i would not recommend taking my analogy on word alone**.",Chemistry
5786,"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesn‚Äôt matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. I‚Äôm more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someone‚Äôs substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. ‚ÄúEconomic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air‚Äù (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what I‚Äôve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. There‚Äôs nothing saying the second law efficiency can‚Äôt be better than 5%, and also it doesn‚Äôt matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency won‚Äôt be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation ‚ÄúLackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.‚Äù In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology won‚Äôt be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I don‚Äôt think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap. Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got.",Physics

The tetrahedron and a hexagonal thing. The hexagonal thing is not the simplest unit so it's pretty easy to see why that's not the unit cell. The tetrahedron I actually only see in your description and I'm reasonably certain the reason it doesn't work is that it does not contain enough information or atoms to rebuild the crystal structure. I'm actually not really seeing a tetrahedron. The best tetrahedron I can see is not regular by any stretch of the imagination and definitely won't tesselate to rebuild an entire crystal from that unit. Did you mean octahedron to include all the face centered atoms in the cubic crystal? The issue there is that if you tesselate the object, you'll skip a bunch of atoms. \n\nThe short answer would be that very smart people have worked on this for over a century and the cube is the simplest unit cell that can be tessellated to reproduce the entire crystal structure. If you have an alternate idea for the unit cell, I guarantee your missing something. You either will skip certain atoms when you tessellate, can't tessellate it at all, or you could create an alternate and simpler unit cell that will also work.",Chemistry

5831,"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years. If someday in the deep unexplored ocean some decendant of [*Anomalocaris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris) was found, it would be the coolest thing, but it wouldn't change current evolutionary theory.",Biology

5952,"So it's a laymen's term and my apologies,  but I try not to get too far into minute details on reddit threads out of fear it won't be fully understood by everyone reading it.\n\nWhen vaccinated, your immune system is ""boosted"" - hence the term ""boost"" or ""booster"" for the vaccine. You get a ""surge"", rapid increase, peak, whatever you want to call it to have it make sense to you (as a virologist, immunologist, entomologist, a new worried father, what have you), shortly after your immune system is stimulated. You would therefore after a vaccination ""booster"" get a ""surge"" or sudden increase in circulating antibodies. In this case for a booster it would be IgG antibodies over IgM, or even in this specific case of a pregnant/post-partum/breast-feeding mother IgA antibodies as it's present in her bodily fluids, but I digress.\n\nThen after a period of time the antibodies go down to almost undetectable levels. There's vast variations in the populations and within individuals, so saying that they go to ""0"" is not entirely accurate. In this day and age with there being no herd immunity, vaccine hesitation and resistance, etc., it's quite possible any particular person may have some level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulating at any point in time. That's why there's ""baseline"" with testing depending on the type of test done and what has been used as a control to establish that test. I've worked in a variety of laboratories and for instance, there's one influenza variant, let's call it variant A, that if your antibody titer is 1:8 or higher, you are considered immune to that virus (1 portion of your serum had enough antibodies present to bind to virus when mixed with blood and diluted at a ratio of 1:8). But let's also say there's another influenza variant, called B, that's a bit more funky, so we consider a titer of 1:16 or 1:32 protective. Or better yet, it's an H5-based influenza virus, in which case it's highly debated if HAI testing is even a good determinant of protective antibody response at all.

Every day life is about electrons, photons, up quarks, down quarks, and gluons. You could maybe make a case to include muons\n\n>The search failed to find the particle, known as the sterile neutrino.\n\nokay, sort of true, but really they didn't test neutrino oscillations, they tested the MiniBooNE low energy excess and disfavored that at solid significance.\n\n> This will now direct physicists towards even more interesting theories to help explain how the Universe came to be.\n\nthis is just making things up.\n\n>That is because a sizeable proportion of physicists have been developing their theories on the basis that the existence of the sterile neutrino was a possibility. \n\nThis is highly misleading: this result does not rule out sterile neutrinos, nor does it rule 1 eV sterile neutrinos, rather it does not find evidence for the low energy excess that MiniBooNE saw which was often interpreted as evidence for a sterile neutrino. Sterile neutrinos could still exist at 1 eV but with smaller mixing with active neutrinos, or sterile neutrino could exist at any other mass range (likely heavier), or both. In fact, sterile neutrinos almost certainly exist somewhere, but they are very tricky to probe.\n\n>why the neutrino has such a tiny mass - which is what allows them to change flavour \n\nthe fact that their mass is tiny is not why they change flavor, rather the fact that they have different masses and that the weak interaction produces a combination of several different mass states.\n\n>its shadowy mirror-image anti-matter\n\nanti-matter is not shadowy; it interacts in essentially exactly the same way as regular matter.\n\n>That result was confirmed by a separate experiment tin 2002.\n\nthey can't even mention the experiment? The paragraph is ambiguous, but I assume from context that they are referring to SNO which measured solar neutrinos confirming the standard flavor-flipping (ugh, that sounds so stupid - why can't they call it oscillations?) not the LSND anomalous result.\n\n>They believed this form of the particle could explain the over-production of electron neutrinos and, crucially, give an insight into why the particles change flavour. \n\nA 1 eV sterile really doesn't explain why neutrinos oscillate in any particular way.\n\nThe article actually winds its way through the leptogenesis problem pretty well; implying a connection without out right saying it.

However, the other part of the story is metabolism. Metabolism is highly complex and involves many molecular conversions to produce various molecules the body might need at any one instance.  \n\nA scenario where glucose might be converted to fat is eating food when your body already has sufficient energy. If the body has sufficient energy, there is no reason to break it down further to produce energy. Instead, glucose can be converted into glycogen, which is a fuel-storage molecule. \n\nGlycogen stores are limited, but fat stores are virtually infinite, so if you overeat, your body tends to start producing fat stores. For creation of fat stores, glucose is converted into triglycerides (basically fat) and it is stored as fat in your body.",Biology

6482,"I don't know that we have an *urgent* need for specific terminology to discuss alien life. Life outside of Earth is completely hypothetical. If we do find it, the relevant language will be invented then and there.\n\nIt's true that we'd have to make up a lot of new taxonomy, though. Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\n\nIf, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet. So ""tree of life"" basically becomes a new taxonomic level above domain.

Using gloves only when they are necessary is more advisable I think (of course you need to know when you need them and learning to be aware of possible dangers is worth a lot). A lot of stuff in the lab, especially teaching labs, is not more dangerous than stuff that is commonly used at home, it is important to differentiate. Also if people wear gloves they tend to care a lot less if they spill something or not and if they do, they contaminate everything instead of cleaning the mess up immediately. Wearing gloves for a prolonged amount of time also causes sweating and opens the pores, which makes the exposure to chemicals even more dangerous and guess what, gloves also have a time limit on how long they guarantee to withstand different chemicals and people also tend to not care about that and wear gloves for hours.\n\nOf course I dont want to abolish gloves, but I think brainless overuse causes more harm, than it does good.

6583,"My brother is the nuclear engineer so I know more than the average chemist but I'm no expert. I'm still reasonably certain that this is wrong. You don't really input energy into a nuclear reactor. You have fuel rods that will always and constantly give off neutrons. You use neutron moderators, usually coolant as water, to thermalize the neutrons and slow them down. Slower neutrons are more likely to collide with uranium for more reactions. Then you use reflectors and absorbers like beryllium and boron, respectively, to control how many neutrons there are around the fuel rods. At no point did I have to input any energy to cause the uranium to decay and give off neutrons. It's just doing what it would do anyways, and I'm controlling it with external factors. \n\nSo from that standpoint, I think the key things for the chemistry of your fuel rods are factors like density of your actual fuel (ie crystal structure), it's propensity to form cracks during it's lifetime, thermal expansion, etc etc. Even if this couterion neutron capture is an issue, I think it would take a back seat to the other factors and be relatively minor. I could 100% be wrong. I think you need to talk to the nuclear engineering reddit to be sure, but that's my understanding.",Chemistry

The solution should be quite concentrated. You'll get a dark green solution of the Ti(III) complex. Let a few drops of this solution evaporate on a clean surface, while the blower is turned on. If you get a green residue after the toluene evaporates, your atmosphere has only a few ppm of O2 at most and I would point to your O2 detector being the problem here.

I find it fascinating because everyone‚Äôs experience is unique but they all flow very similarly. Regardless of gender, race, location, culture, or creed - people have extremely similar ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù experiences when they experience an NDE or psychoactive compound. Whether it‚Äôs LSD where eyes are open, or DMT with closed eyes while seeing more vividly than ever imagined‚Ä¶the experiences are so strikingly similar. With DMT, why would people see the same ‚Äúentities‚Äù even if they‚Äôve never heard reference of them beforehand? I‚Äôm not saying that with DMT you go off on an astral trip and meet inter-dimensional beings. But what IS happening? HOW are our humans brains so alike that we hallucinate the exact same ridiculous looking things in an altered state? How have people completely healed themselves from addictions after ‚Äúmeeting Mother Auyhuasca‚Äù?

Well, we don‚Äôt really NEED to understand the why to see that it does, regardless of our understanding. But I do believe we will understand it better someday. Whatever it is, it IS scientific and it just IS the way things are. Either we as humans have the ability to hallucinate the same experiences and exact images as strangers across the globe, or it‚Äôs a spiritual experience suggesting that there is way more than just this earthly plane of existence. It‚Äôs one of those two things and they are both really freaking cool.

Overall: the plastic has irreversibly lost a small part of itself but not enough to change the size of the brick.\n\nAdding peroxide + UV introduces more even stronger radicals - BAM! kick it up a notch.  They attack the yellow polymer only at the site that is missing a hydrogen atom and essentially chop it in half. No more yellow coloured molecule.\n\nDownside is the polymer is no longer elastic.  It's brittle.  What you un-intentionally end up doing is scraping off that tiny thin brittle layer to expose fresh plastic underneath.\n\nYou can repeat the process many times so long as you have material remaining.

For example, the molecule acetic acid (the sour part of vinegar) is C2H4O2. On one of the C atoms there are three H atoms and then the next C along. The four bonds around that carbon predict a geometry where the angles are roughly 109.5 degrees- the ‚Äútetrahedral‚Äù shape. Then the other C has a three bonds: one from the first C, a (double) bond to one of the oxygen atoms, and a bond to the second oxygen. With three bonds we‚Äôll say the best geometry is planar, with the bonds at 120 degree angles. Finally that second oxygen has the bond to the H atom, plus non-bonding electron pairs.    \nSo even that simple molecule can be thought of as having 3 ‚Äúcentral‚Äù atoms.",Chemistry

At this point you are asking things that are explained in middle school science classes before they even call the class chemistry, or at least my middle school called it Science class.  A gas has atoms less densely packed than a liquid or solid.  A nebulizer  uses an atomizer to disperse the drug and in turn and intrinsically turns it into a gas or at least decreases the droplet size small enough to be inhaled without choking.  The less mass something has the less effect gravity has on it.  Something under about 80nm is uneffected by gravity.  Although the droplets are larger than this they do have such little mass at those sizes that they are temporarily suspended in air.  This is essentially a fog not steam.  Of course steam is acting on similar principles and is also lifted into the air by thermodynamics. Speaking of your earlier example of liquids those are suspensions in liquids usually mostly water with some flavoring to make it easier to swallow whereas a nebulizer or inhaler is a suspension in air. Gases mix homogeneously without even mixing like a liquid.  At this point it is getting a bit difficult to explain to you because you are requiring an explanation of underpinnings that should be understood and implied.  Again see basic chemistry and physics.

And round numbers make it easier. Once you think you have a plan, give the actual numbers a final check. (And good to have someone there double-check.)\n\nDo you need to correct for the volume added?

7071,"Disagree. I'm not a knee-jerk anti-nuclear wingnut, but given the dramatic progress in intermittent renewables over the past decade, the use-case for nuclear is substantially smaller than many redditors seem to think it is. There's certainly a good case to be made for nuclear power for clean load-following or baseload electricity generation, but that's about it. My experience is mostly limited to American energy policy, but there's not much reason to believe other countries would have it substantially better when even the French nuclear industry is broadly declining.\n\nDue to the numerous safety regulations governing nuclear power plant construction, upkeep, and decommissioning (which, for the record, I think are a good thing), nuclear power plants are expensive as hell and take forever to build. kWh for kWh, they simply cannot compete economically with cheap silicon PV. Even if they could, a primarily nuclear energy industry would require new power plants being finished across the country every few days just to keep up with the rate at which they'd be decommissioned. Given how long they take to build, it's easy to see that the modern American nuclear industry is literally multiple orders of magnitude away from providing more than ancillary support to a broader green energy economy, powered primarily by solar and wind.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a universe where investment in nuclear energy deployment continued apace for the past few decades, laying the foundation for a zero-carbon nuclear future.

7084,"So far people commenting are forgetting about *length contraction*: If I'm moving at relativistic speeds, in my reference frame the distance between where I start and where I end up shrinks. Time is still passing for me, but the distance I travel approaches zero as I get closer to the speed of light. At the speed of light, then, the distance *is* zero. Better, points at lightlike separation are a distance zero from each other in the Minkowski metric.\n\nThe implication that confuses the OP, then, is that this means that, in the reference frame of a photon, it exists for only an instant: It is instantaneously transmitted from its origin to its destination, and thus in its frame *no time passes*. In our frame of course it takes time for the light to move, because light doesn't move infinitely fast and the distance between its origin and its destination *isn't* zero. In the photon's frame that distance *is* zero. This is indeed strange, for it says that a photon ""sees"" the universe as flat, with all distances parallel to its direction of travel shrunk to zero; and as far as the photon is concerned it seems not to exist for any time at all.\n\nTo that all I can say is that photons aren't people; they seem to get along with their weird lives with little worry. I don't exactly want to make the excuse that I'm a physicist and not a philosopher, since understanding the ontology is important for the physics, but it is true that special relativity works.

7092,"Okay so this is a tough question, let me try to bring some light to it.\nSo, the issue here lies with the interpretation on Quantum Mechanics. QM postulates describe how do systems work. They are true (as far as we know), but they don't give a further explanation as to why is the world like this. These postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system. The measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement. And the instants before and after the measurement, the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour. However, what does it mean to perform a measurement? The measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude (it could be energy, speed, position... of the system). Usually, we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements, since, in the limit, they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equations(if they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument we'll toss it under the carpet). So, in these cases, even if there's no evident observer, there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems. \nThis means that you don't need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunction.\n\nHowever, if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function, one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isn't collapsed. Then, you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave. What happens with all the other possible discarded states (universes in this case) is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qm.\n\nTL;DR: we don't need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions, the universe is and will be a quantum state\n\nHope it was useful:)",Physics

7211,"Thallium possesses several closed shells of d and f-electrons, but once they are completely filled they tend to become irrelevant. (hence the comparison of distance to xenon and radon is a bit inaccurate) A very important aspect is the inert pair effect of s-electrons. It simply states that as you go to higher rows, e. g within the 3rd main group from boron to aluminium to gallium to indium and finally to thallium, the s-electrons become increasingly more difficult to access. The effect originates from quantum mechanics. This means in essence that the tendency of being most stable in the +I compared to the +III state increases with increasing mass of the element. In other words, removing both s-electrons from the valence shell of thallium is more difficult than for indium, gallium, aluminium or boron. (The same trend applies also to the 4th and somewhat to the 5th main group) Negative oxidation states are for  elements of the 3rd main group exceedingly rare, because their electromegativities are relatively low. This means that the valence shell of thallium for example is barely capable of accommodating one additional electron. negatively charged thallium ions are therefore rarely formed.

7217,"One should keep in mind that most dark matter ""alternatives"", including this one, actually include dark matter. It says so right on the 2nd page of their paper:\n\n> Consider requirement (iii), that is, successful cosmology. In (2) we have a new d.o.f. œÜ [...] What should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of œï be? The MOND law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter. There is, however, another empirical law which concerns cosmology: the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a^(‚àí3).\n\nIn other words, they are saying that to get the cosmology right, they need to add dark matter -- that is what they are alluding to with the ""sizable amounts of energy"". They make their œÜ field play this role. It's just like TeVeS, the other major relativistic MOND theory, where the scalar ""S"" field does the same thing.\n\nThe popular press likes to frame the debate as ""dark matter vs. modified gravity"", but it's really ""dark matter vs. dark matter plus modified gravity"". The hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better, at the cost of higher theoretical complexity. If you read the paper, the authors aren‚Äôt trying to do away with dark matter at all ‚Äî their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstacles.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also feel like I should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is ""less elegant"" than dark matter. These days, dark matter models are not about elegance at all, they're about minimality: trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles, with the simplest possible interactions, focusing on the dumbest possible first guess. There was an era where people to make dark matter ""elegantly"" fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the Standard Model at once, but that ship has sailed because those theories didn't work. As scientists we should just follow the evidence, without theoretical prejudice. It just so happens that at the moment most of the evidence points towards dark matter.",Physics

7219,"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell. Sounds counter intuitive, but that's just because writing it out in words introduces imprecisions.",Physics

7308,"Okay that makes more sense to me. In that case, it's either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing. It's probably not kinetic but just in case, you could try cooling it more slowly. Idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water. I don't think this will work but maybe.\n\nOtherwise, the issue seems to be one of partitioning. You have 2 phases, either stearic acid in the SLN or the lipid tails of the tween 20. As is, they are virtually identical. Both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains. Could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase? Clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances, it should still prefer aromatic substances. If you can up the aromatic content of your SLN, it might stay in place more. Aromatic body friendly things seem rare though. Cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe? Some vitamin B's or E look promising. Tryptophan might even work. \n\nCome to think of it, the whole thing is weird to me. It's a little weird that you have SLN's and micelles both existing. It seems like there's just too much surfactant as it means your covering the SLN's entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc. But the other bit that's weird is that a drug dissolved in a SOLID lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase. If it's solid, it shouldn't really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase. So... kinetics might not actually be far off. I was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the SLN formation. If you can get the SLN's formed before diluting, you should be golden. But I'm guessing that's the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise. I'm kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water. It will fall out of solution, but if it forms the right sized particles, you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing and/or sonication, resuspend the stearic acid mixture. Even if you are forming micelles, it should be solid already and avoid the issue. But it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension. Who knows? Concentration is still probably the best bet.",Chemistry

We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> ‚Ä¶According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world. That‚Äôs because our brain has brought it into the workspace, which maintains it independently of the time and place at which we first perceived it.",Biology

From the creature's point of view, the object is not a collection of equal sides and angles, like a cube is supposed to be, but rather, the creature sees two differently sized squares linked together (just like a drawing of a cube).  \n\nLike the creature, we cannot see or comprehend a cube in the 4th dimension, but we can comprehend its shadow as projected onto our 3D world. A tesseract, as it's called, is simply a small cube centered within a larger cube with the vertices connected. From our perspective, the cubes are not equal sizes and the connection points are not equal to the sides of the squares, but regardless of our perception, it is a perfectly equilateral object in the 4th dimension, and each face is its own cube. We know this because, in order to create a 4th dimensional cube (tesseract), you would have to take 3D cubes and seperate them equally across a brand new direction, one that does not exist in our reality (just like ""up"" and ""down"" are brand new directions that do not exist in the reality of the Flat Worlder).\n\nMy point is, a virtual reality experience of the 4th dimension would still be grounded in the 3rd, because that's all we can experience. You're right in that we can calculate these 4th dimensional objects and possibly insert them into a virtual reality code, but all we would be able to see are the ""shadows"" of the objects, like the 3D representation of a tesseract.\n\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/55433/in-what-sense-is-a-tesseract-shown-4-dimensional",Physics

Really highly ionic salts like sulfates are barely soluble in anything but water. They will be slightly soluble in things like ethanol or methanol but the problem with them is they are quite unstable (electrochemically speaking) which means you won't be able to reach high voltages at all.\n\nAlso going to non-aqueous immediately introduces the problem of water sensitivity, your salts will likely be wet and even if you do find a cheap solvent that will dissolve the salts in a desirable concentration then it too will suck up water from the atmosphere over time which can have an effect on performance (again reducing voltage stability)",Chemistry

In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we‚Äôve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don‚Äôt fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology

Beyond these very high level qualitative explanations that re-emission happens, you can also look at a physical chemistry textbook or a solid state physics textbook for a discussion of the interaction between photons and vibrational modes.

7741,"You make some fair points, but I‚Äôm a little unsure about your main argument. \n\nAre you saying that all of the energy gained from the past 100-150 years of burning fossil fuels would have to be used to capture the CO2 in the atmosphere, and that we won‚Äôt be able to generate that much energy because we will also have to be powering society with renewables? If this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as I‚Äôm aware, I don‚Äôt think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I don‚Äôt know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldn‚Äôt be using fossil fuels for energy. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúclean coal‚Äù or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. It‚Äôs not a fixed cost for every material. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we aren‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúunburn the coal.‚Äù Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isn‚Äôt coal. This can be CO2 bound to amines in aqueous amine solutions or CO2 bound to some calcium compound among other things, but I don‚Äôt think the energy required for the adsorption has to be equal to the initial energy used.",Physics

7943,"Here is a write-up I made some time back after I went through this and then had friends do so. Hope it helps!\n\nPantry moth (Indian meal moth): Plodia interpunctella. It is different from other meal moth species, including the common meal moth, Pyralis farinalis. Adults are tricolored above, wavy patterned below, and with the tiny abdomen tip held at about 90 degrees to body plane. Now pantropical (and in warm temperate regions), it may have originated in Central America.\n\nTheir diet is unusually broad, including grains and many foods made with at least some grain including cereals, breads, muffins, pasta, pet food, bird seed, but apparently also some nuts, candy bars, peanut butter, possibly starches such as corn starch, tapioca, etc.\n\nThe peak adult activity is around dusk. During daytime the adults mostly remain inactive in dark spots (e.g. crevices). Adults are moderately attracted to light, especially in the blue to violet range.\n\nThey are readily detectable using pheremone traps (scented tent-traps). Deter them by using airtight, adequate  food containers or double bagging, as well as using essential oils and nontoxic pantry moth spray. All stages including eggs are readily killed in a short time by temperatures over c. 130¬∞F (e.g. in a car in the sun on a hot day) or freezing for 72 hours.\n\nUnlike most meal moths, the larvae of this species readily chew through paper, some plastics including processed-cereal freshness liners, and even thin cardboard. Double-bagging with Ziplock bags is normally adequate unless populations are large. Tupperware style containers only work if they completely seal (""airtight""). Put open food away promptly and avoid leaving pet food out more than a day or two.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

7973,"1.The fact that he's young and healthy doesn't necessarily mean COVID won't hit him hard. Plus, the more people are vaccinated the better because the virus won't be able to transmit so easily, replicate and MUTATE. So we are more likely to get worse COVID variants if there are not enough people vaccinated. Not to mention there's a higher chance that he will spread it to his grandma or something. \n\n2. I honestly can't think how you can hit an artery in the upper arm muscle? Or even a major blood vessel.   But let's assume the vaccine goes straight into the blood stream. Nano-lipid particles are quite fragile. They're often covered in PEG to even make them stay longer in the bloodstream otherwise they would get opsonised and eaten by macrophages quickly. In order for these nano-lipids to ""enter every cell of the body"" they would have to extravasate from the blood stream and that wouldn't be so easy either (not to mention there wouldn't be enough of them to enter every cell). Usually people rely on cancer vasculature to be more ""leaky"" and try to use liposomes as drug carriers for instance. Because they would in theory accumulate in tumour. Probably the worst case scenario if by some miracle you injected the vaccine into the bloodstream would be that you might not develop an immunological memory for COVID or feel a bit worse. Even if mRNA entered some other cells, they would just start producing this spike protein. And sure, the immune cells would destroy these ""infected"" cells but there's nowhere near enough mRNA injected to cause any real damage that way (especially if it's dispersed and ""diluted"" in your body in this scenario). So essentially in the muscle the cells will start producing the spike protein (which is not secretory because some people wrongly suggest that you have a lot of this protein accumulated in your body), the immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) would find it, carry it to lymph nodes and activate T cells and B cells. There are a lot of DCs in the muscle so it's a great place to inject a vaccine. \n\n3. I honestly can't see how an mRNA vaccine can mess up your immune system and make it not work properly. It just mimicks what happens in any other viral infection. Your friend's argument is sooo general it's annoying. If he told you a suggested mechanism of action of this, then we can discuss. But like this? He should provide a source with a proof of that. \n\n4. Some people already answered. I don't really know the history of mRNA vaccine clinical trials so I won't say much. But let's not forget some companies didn't manage to make good mRNA vaccines for COVID (and tried), and that a lot of money and effort from thousands of scientist went to make these vaccines work. That for sure played a part in this success. \n\n5. I really don't like anegdotal evidence. What does it mean he ""measured""? Did this doctor actually designed a study and properly measured a correlation between a vaccination and all these diseases? And published it? If not, then his words don't mean anything.",Biology

That is to say, there is no such thing as the temperature of a single atom, nor the pressure of a single atom, but rather these macroscopic properties (of a gas, say) can be very accurately modeled as emerging from the many trillions of well-understood kinetic collisions of those atoms. In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we‚Äôve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don‚Äôt fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology

The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being 1-sn the carbon at the top and 3-sn the one at the bottom.\n\nThe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration (D or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.\n\nFor example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.\n\nMost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or 3-sn position.[5] Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2-sn, with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or sn3 position.[5]",Chemistry

8097,"My knowledge of the nutrition literature is very sketchy further back than the year 2000.\n\nThe 9 essential amino acids were known by the 1940s. Its the same 9 essential amino acids for humans, cows, chickens, and *all* animals. No animal is an essential amino acid producer, they're all ""middlemen"". In evolution, creatures that evolved to eat plants or other animals lost the same set of metabolic pathways early, over 1000 million years ago.\n\nNutritional requirements for protein have become better defined with time. I'd recommend the WHO's [Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Human Nutrition](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf;jsessionid=42513E10FE32E690D087BCDF2725806C?sequence=1), from 2007, for the still current consensus.\n\nThe requirements are fairly fixed by lean body mass, and its still common for some elderly to fall short, mostly because they're sedentary and eat so few calories in total that the dietary proportions that served them in youth no longer provide enough protein to support immune function. There's no requirement for the elderly to consume animal products, but for those who consume fewer calories in total, the requirement for protein may rise from the \~10% of calories required in younger people to 15-20% of calories. The additional protein could come from eggs & cheese, or from legumes and tofu.\n\nThere was an [interesting paper from 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311400062X) which found mild protein restriction was associated with protection against chronic disease and mortality, but only up to age 65 to 70. After that, higher protein intake in the 10-20% range improved survival. I think in this study we're seeing both some benefit from mild protein restriction in preventing cardiovascular and metabolic disease in middle age, and also a benefit of ensuring enough protein for our immune cells to proliferate in response to infection, in the elderly.\n\nI eat a plant based diet for health, and became fascinated with the nutrition and health literature about a decade ago. Because plant based diets can be unbalanced, I was concerned about the essential amino acids likely to be deficient. The key requirement for  is 30 mg/kg/day of lysine, and 15 mg/kg/day for methionine + cysteine (from table 49 of the WHO document cited above). Meet those, and its pretty much assured the other essential amino acids will be adequate. In practice, it generally means most plant based eaters need 2-3 servings of legumes daily, to ensure adequate lysine. People with weirder diets, like alcoholics, may need more protein heavy foods.",Biology

When they find one they like, they'll bury them and pat them down.\n\nIf you feel like harvesting them, the next step is drying them.   Then put them in water and trashing the ones that float or the ones that have tiny holes in them (bugs).  Then you crack them open, trash bad ones, and crush them.  I soak them in a bowl and change the water at first 2-3x/day, and stop once I'm changing the water once every 3 days.  Basically go until you leech out most of the tannins and they're not bitter anymore.\n\nIn the end, \~1/2 the acorns you'd pick up and even consider are bad.",Biology

The problems that the inflationary hypothesis solves are legitimate problems that don't appear to have any simpler solution at the present time.  However, the main problem that MOND was introduced to solve has an adequate and vastly simpler alternative solution (dark matter), and these days MOND doesn't even fully solve that problem on its own and still needs some dark matter to match observations.\n\nSo, you're calling what is arguably the simplest solution to a set of real problems a ""gigantic hack"" while comparing it to a non-solution to a different problem that already has a much simpler solution.\n\nAt the end of the day, we need an actual solution to things like the horizon problem.  The phrasing you used to characterize inflation makes it sound like you would consider *any* solution to be a ""hack"" simply because it would be more complicated than current models without any solution, and that seems misguided.

71,"If by expired you just mean outlasts its sell-by or use-by date, but is still sealed up inside the bottle or can, then probably not much. If the seal is still good and no air can get in, then there won't be much decomposition in most cases.\n\nThe exceptions will be certain wines or beers which still contain some live yeasts - you can tell which ones these are because there will be some visible sediment at the bottom of the bottle. These also tend to have shorter dates on them, because they can go bad much quicker. The temperature of storage also makes a big difference to these - if kept refrigerated they will probably outlast their dates, if kept in a warm storage room they likely won't. Anyway, the active yeast will be slowly consuming any sugars still present in the drink, the rate depending on temperature. So the drink will eventually end up very dry, sour and probably somewhat over-carbonated - if the bottle hasn't exploded by that time!\n\nFor the other category you mentioned where the drink is exposed to the air, it depends on what the alcohol content starts at. For spirits, they will at first lose alcohol by evaporation, until the percentage by volume drops to a level where bacteria can actually survive in the solution. From that point, bacteria will start to grow, including the type which metabolise alcohol into acetic acid.\n\nFor wines and beers, the bacterial contamination will begin much more quickly (within days) if open to the air. So again, bacteria will start to grow, and the alcohol content will start being converted into acetic acid, forming vinegar. If enough bacteria grow, you can end up with a slimy layer on the top, which is a combination of the bacteria themselves and their other metabolic products, one of which is cellulose, which forms the slime or jelly-like substance, known in the brewing trade as ""mother of vinegar"". The reason it has this name is that you can take a piece of this and add it to any other wine or beer and it will kick-start the vinegar production at an accelerated rate.\n\nIf you want a vinegar acceptable for use as a condiment or in cooking, then you ideally want an acetic acid content somewhere between 3 and 6 %, and a residual alcohol content between 0.5 and 1 %. If the bacterial fermentation is allowed to continue until all the alcohol is consumed, then different bacteria take over which start consuming the acetic acid. They will then carry on doing that until all the acetic acid is gone too, and then you will be left with basically water with a lot of dead bacteria in it. This may subsequently grow mould, but it would be useless long before it got that far.",Chemistry

So the premise of your question is already wrong.  \n\nOpen questions exist within the incredibly technical details when formulating a quantum field theory for gravity. But there is zero reason to speculate on a completely different ""mechanism"" for gravity based on pure guessing, thats just not how science works.\n\nOne remark on your idea, trying to relate gravity to magnetism just makes no sense. Even before Einstein, gravity in Newtonian physics and magnetism are just way to different: The gravitational field has monopoles, the magnetic field cannot have monopoles, only at least dipoles (every magnetic source ever has a north and a south pole, while there is only one gravitational charge aka mass). A gravitational field applies work on a test charge, a magnetic field doesn't. There are many other similar discrepancies, and these are only the most basic ones that everyone learns in their first year at university.\n\nAs a remark, I realize that all this may come of as a bit condescending, and it is good that you are interested in this stuff and try to think it through yourself. But the truth is, you won't solve any problems or even get the right ideas by guessing based on half-truths and half-knowledge.

78,"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don‚Äôt want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried ‚Äúsalt bridges‚Äù where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to ‚Äúbend‚Äù the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains ‚Äúzip up‚Äù very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that‚Äôs going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I‚Äôve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher‚Äôs hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",Biology

85,"It is just a formal notation. NO3^(-)-N means somehting like ""nitrogens in nitrate"". \n\nExample: you are testing a 10 L soil sample for nitrate. You get 1 mole of nitrate es result.

If you are now calculation the mass concentration you would get \n\n- c(NO3^(-)) = N*62u per 10 L\n- or c(NO3^(-)N) = N*14u per 10 L\n\nnote: N is the dimensionless avogadro number\n\nSo in easy words: it's nitrate just calculated like nitrogen. This is often used in enviormental chemistry, food chemistry and other related fields, because upper limits are often defined via a max nitrogen equivalent.

193,"I'll disagree with saying dopamine is ""the cause"" of addiction. Here's my view. Addiction is a lock and key. If you gave Adderall to a large random sample some would hate it, some would not. Some fraction would be more mentally effective but not addicted, and some would become addicted regardless of any pharmacological benefit.\n\nAn example: I was on morphine for about 2 weeks after serious surgery when I was in my early 20s. I was taken off of it fairly suddenly when I went home. I had physical withdrawal but didn't realize it, and called my doctor with ""odd"" symptoms. He literally laughed on the phone but didn't say why, and gave me a prescription for a tranquilizer for a week or two. A few days later a friend explained it. So, did I crave opiates when I went off, or after I found out what happened? No. Would I have considered it taking it if I could somehow get it free and safely? Not even a little. I have a life to lead, thank you. What about years later when I went through chronic depression and had had personal experience or familiarity with more addictive things? No, never called to me. Does that make me better than an addict? Absolutely not, just lucky in that particular way. \n\nAs a baseline (possibly genetic), most people have very low to moderately low vulnerability to addiction, but more is fairly common. If someone with significant baseline potential is in a situation of chronic pain, either physical or emotional, their vulnerability goes up rapidly in proportion to the pain.\n\nEmotional pain can be things people don't even realize is pain because they've normalized it. Low self esteem, a bad marriage, a sense of failure, a phobia or chronic anxiety, fear about a large scale issue like climate change, or chronic hate (at the government, women, themselves, or whatever).\n\nWhy have addiction rates skyrocketed in the US? You don't have to be anyplace on the political spectrum, and barely awake, to know the problem. Suicide and crime rates skyrocketing. Obesity and diabetes skyrocketing. People hate social media and use it more than ever. Ever larger corporations and no privacy. The country has been gradually tearing itself apart more and more.\n\nThere is one and only one trigger for addiction rates climbing ever since The US Vietnam War and 60's social strife, up through the (current) pandemic and strife. One trigger: increasing chronic, individual pain. Any coincidence that the steepest climb in addictions lately is in pain medication? I think not.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

So, it's pretty plausible that the parameter Œò is zero.

Of course, this is a slightly more complex mechanism (replacing a number with a field), but it would work perfectly - and this is basically what we also did with particle masses. Before we treated them as pure numbers, but then Higgs came up with the idea that those might be caused by a field. And every field comes with a particle attached to it, and as you might have heard, we found that Higgs-particle.\n\nSo, if there is a field for our parameter Œò, then this also comes with another particle, and this is the axion. The existence of this particle would immediatly solve our original problem of possible processes never occuring, it would also be very, very light and have all the properties we need for a dark matter particle. And us cosmologists need dark matter to explain a lot about the universe - there seems to be a lot more mass in the universe than we can find. And we notice this lack of mass in many, many different scenarios.\n\nThe axion could easily solve two of the biggest outstanding problems in physics, the strong CP problem and the dark matter problem. And it comes as natural as the Higgs-mechanism. It's almost too good to be true.",Physics

Fork offset changes steer angle in a lean - if there were no offset on the fork, the wheel would just flop to the side when driving straight because with a slackened steering axis, the wheel is actually at it's highest point when pointed straight, and 90 degrees to the direction of travel is it's lowest point. Due to the castor effect, fork offset causes the wheel to point forward when the bike is upright, but also causes the fork to self-steer into a lean due to the offset from the steering axis. A fork with zero offset would tend to point out of a turn while leaning. \n\nTL;DR: Bag is heavy on one side. Lean other direction to balance center of gravity.

The brain is the most complex structure in the universe and so the consciousness is very likely to be an emergent property of the brain. \n\n\nOther support for the second school is that we can alter consciousness by altering the brain and/or its chemicals, suggesting that the brain is the basis for the mind. \n\n\nOf course, the first idea I presented is usually favoured by religious/spiritual people, and I'd suggest it's because they want to believe in something bigger than a materialist view of the universe, suggested by the the second idea. However, that's not disproof. The neurologist D. Hoffman believes in the first school of thought. I think his argument has some holes and he has sent me some counter arguments to read, but I haven't had time to do so yet.

366,"There are 4 effects at play here.\n\nNote, most times mixing a strong base and vinegar most times achieves nothing other than making fizzy water.\n\nFirst: a process called ""salting out"".  Add a pinch of ordinary table salt to acrylic paints and it will destabilize, separate and you get a clear layer of water on top of thick sludge.  Analogy is you have a stable positive magnet floating and then you toss a whole bunch of negative magnets to make it crash.  Most polymers are stable only at certain controlled ionic balances.  Some stains work by sticking really tightly to the surface of a material, almost like a magnet or velcro.  Stain()+ <---> (-)fibre.   Blood, some paints, protein and a few others.  Adding a whole bunch of salt overwhelms any ionic interactions and disrupts the intermolecular interactions bonds so you end up with stain.Cl and fibre.Na.  The stain material just falls off.\n\nSecond: Vinegar that has been neutralized or in the acetate form is very good at ""chelating"" calcium compounds.  Your acrylic paint probably contains about 20% calcite (chalk) as a filler.  By using the acetate ion you remove the calcite, which loosens all the paint.\n\nThird: pH effects.  The acrylic latex usually contains a lot of acid functional groups from acrylic acid polymers.  When you add ammonia it can make the polymer soften.  Tough to explain the chemical theory, but acrylic polymers change hardness (glass transition) by a lot depending if they are at high or low pH (ionic or neutral acid form).  As the ammonia evaporates your solution pH will also drop.  By swapping pH you are doing the chemical equivalent of pushing it backwards and forwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForth: salt is a mild abrasive.  You effectively sand papered off the top layer of your clothing.  This is basis for the product Barkeepers Friend or Jiff.  Magic eraser would have the same effect.",Chemistry

The neutrons in this experiment are ""ultacold neutrons"" (E < a few hundred neV) so 10B has a very high capture cross section. The capture reaction is 10B (n,alpha) 7Li.\n\nThe detector is built like a sandwich. On the outer edges are ~20 nm of 10B. The interior layer is ZnS, a scintillator. In the middle there is acrylic that has wavelength-shifting fibers (WLSF) built into it. From left to right, the structure is 10B : ZnS : acrylic and WLSF : ZnS : 10B.\n\nWhen a neutron captures on 10B either an alpha or a 7Li passes through the ZnS, and the scintillation light is gathered into the WLSF. The WLSF carry the light to the PMTs, and from there the signal can be digitized. One key feature of this detector is that the WLSF are laid out in alternating fashion, so adjacent WLSF transmit light to different PMTs.

415,"I can attest from personal experience it is impossible to ride with more than a small amount of weight. I'm sure many a child has figured out the hard way that letting go of the handlebars while an external force is acting on them (such as wind, a bag of groceries, or a dog leash) is an extremely bad idea. The precise effect depends on the bicycle geometry - the fork angle, wheel offset, handlebar width, handle bar offset from the axis of steering, the rider's weight and position. For example shorter handlebar offsets causes lateral loads to contribute more to leaning the bike, whereas longer offsets causes the load to produce more steer and offset the weight from the steering axis considerably. The tire's trail affects how the bike handles at a given steer and lean angle. Most of the time though, the slackened steering produces a reversed castor wheel effect, a bag of groceries on one side will mostly tend to just steer very severely that direction in an attempt to reach the local minima of the slanted steering axis. Depending on the exact geometry, skill, weight, etc it's possible to just no-hands around in a circle with a weight on one bar, where the steering force is counteracted by the centripetal normal force, as that weight is directly analogous to a rider applying the same load with their hands to enter a turn, however this represents a singular self-stable state. If the bag is swinging around dramatically from the unsteadiness it would produce, you now have this crazy double-pendulum chaotic system. The question gets more interesting when you add a dog leash to the equation, as the force can now act along angles that the bike was not designed to self-stabilize against. The leash can be pulling out of a turn while the bike is attempting to steer into it which can cause sudden inversions in the force vectors along an unexpected axis, leading to undesireable behavior such as the wheel suddenly being oversteered, or the bike leaning out of a turn while steering into it. One can easily experiment with this unusual dynamic system with just two bikes - by riding one and pushing another beside yourself by the handlebars, you can feel how changing the position of your hand on the bar changes how the driving, slowing, banking, and steering forces all get mixed up.",Physics

I entered as a computer science major. I have done really well so far, currently having a 3.97 GPA. Over this past year, my Grandfather entered hospice care. I have been taking care of him at night and in the mornings. I help him go to the bathroom and make sure he is clean. I give him baths and help administer medicine. I guess I'm trying to say I enjoy taking care of him. I feel drawn to the healthcare field now and I no longer really love computer science. I used to code for fun(make apps/build websites) but haven't felt the urge or desire to attempt any new projects. Looking out 5/10 years from now I don't really see myself being happy with software development even if there is a lot of money to be made. I think I want to become a doctor. I have always had a heart for taking care of people and I think becoming a doctor would be incredibly rewarding.  \nAnyways, I decided to take gen chem and biology as electives alongside my CS courses this semester to see if I could major in one of them. I am doing well in both of them right now with A's. I enjoy both courses but was wondering which one would be a better fit for me. Biology seems to involve a lot more memorization but also looks at how larger systems work. This is somewhat similar to CS problem solving in that it breaks complex systems into smaller ones that are more easily manageable. My chem course has more problem solving and math. I'm not the biggest fan of memorizing info even though I am pretty good at it. I enjoy math and breaking a problem down into more logical steps. I would rather work on 20 calculus problems for a couple of hours than review notecards for a couple of hours.

A 12 gauge shotgun slug is about 18mm accross so let's say that's how far you need to move your hand to not get hit. How long does it take someone to move their hand 18mms? I have no idea and no clue how I'd find that out, but I'd bet it's not very long. Let's call it a tenth of a second, not including reaction time. So that gives us a range of about 99m. All of this is assuming, of course, that you only notice the shot when it just leaves the barrel.

I know what you are about to say: maybe it's just something that happens in the LCMS through ionization! 1. there was an extra peak for this mass in the UV and molecule e also kinda proves that c really exists.  \nAlso, I expect **c** to undergo an S-N acyl shift, so I would obtain an amide and a free cysteine (**shown in d**). They do have the same mass\n\n**e** would be the disulfide formed between the free Thiol of b and d. Upon addition of TCEP to the mixture this mass vanished. This would also prove the S-N acyl shift theory\n\nSo:  1. why is there deacetylation happening in the first place?\n\nAnd here comes the biggest question mark: I have 3 substrates, they all look quite similar to a except they don‚Äôt have an acetyl-protected amine (they don't have an amine close to this position at all). Still, they all show these weird rearrangement (or whatever) masses. This would speak for another part of the molecule participating in these side reactions. (the structures drawn above are just interpretations of the masses based on the original molecule)\n\nDo you have any other suggestions about what could happen? Is there another shift I don‚Äôt know of between Amides and thioesters? Could the secondary Amine participate in this reaction (because the secondary amine is also present in every substrate)\n\nI am very confused by the outcome of this reaction and any ideas or suggestions would be very appreciated!",Chemistry

Then once it meets the edge of where there is less to no other gasses in the atmosphere it has to just push against gravity now and right there it glides right into space with ease.

And also more broadly why you think the energy required to capture carbon must be greater than or equal to the energy we gained from it initially. After looking more into it, I‚Äôm a little more skeptical. \n\nYou can see here (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=73&t=11) that different sources produce different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same amount of energy produced. When climeworks or anyone else captures CO2, there will be a fixed energy cost. It won‚Äôt vary based on whether the CO2 being captured came from burning coal or natural gas or from some natural process. All of these will generate CO2 with different amounts of energy produced. Like I said before, carbon capture isn‚Äôt trying to reverse the initial carbon emission process. The CO2 ends up bound in a different molecule or solid than it initially was before it was emitted. In fact, when gas phase CO2 binds to a typical adsorbent, it is energetically favored for the CO2 to be bound, so that energy will be released in the form of heat. This heating up of the material upon CO2 adsorption is actually problematic sometimes since the heat has to be dissipated for more CO2 to bind, depending on the way CO2 binds to the material. \n\nIn this type of adsorbing set up, the main energy cost is associated with desorption of the CO2. The energy inputted to desorb the CO2 is completely independent of the energy gained when the coal or oil was burned. The energy needed to desorb the bound CO2 depends only on the specifics of the adsorbing materials, and we are capable of generating materials with a large range of adsorption enthalpies.",Physics

646,"This is wrong, as has been mentioned elsewhere.\n\nWe know a ton about DM and it is not a placeholder for anything. We know how much of it there was at the point of last scattering due to precision measurements of the CMB's temperature temperature correlation (as well as from polarization information). We also know how much there was due to measurements of the abundances of light elements. It is because these two measurements agree that we *really* believe that DM is what we think it is. But we also know its radial profile in galaxies, that it doesn't interact with regular matter much, that it doesn't interact with itself much, that it clumps, that this clumpiness dictates the large scale structure of the universe, and probably other things that I'm forgetting. All of these things point to a self consistent picture of a cold fluid that has thermally evolved like matter and has been present in corresponding densities since the very early universe.\n\nA lot of non-physicists have this idea that DM is just rotation curves and nothing else. That is *not* why we believe DM exists, although it is one more data set that points to a consistent picture, and it is the first data set pointing towards DM, but far from the most precise.\n\nAs for DE, it is also not a placeholder. We see that we have recently (a few billion years ago) entered into a DE dominated era where the evolution of the Hubble parameter is increasingly dominated by DE. The primary data set for this is type 1a SNe. While this data set is tricky, there are a large number of independent checks of DE, notably intrinsic curvature. In addition, we have looked for higher order moments in the acceleration of the universe and not found any, suggesting that DE is what we think it is. Finally, we know that the equation of state of DE is close to -1 as expected from the cosmological constant.\n\nWhat is going on right now in these areas? Many things. For DM, people are using the open data from experiments like GAIA to detect substructures in the galactic DM halo, which is mind boggilingly awesome. As for DE, with upcoming experiments like Vera Rubin we will increase our SNe data set by orders of magnitude.\n\nFinally, the dark sector mentioned in this article isn't the same as dark energy or dark matter, although it could be. Despite the fact that these names all sound related and very vague - dark sector, dark matter, dark energy - they are distinct things. The article is about neutrinos and an anomaly at 4.8sig that just got weirder: obvious explanations don't work so people are turning to less obvious things. This is the way discoveries work. Something strange happens in the data (MiniBooNE sees an excess), the simplest interpretation is investigated (a sterile neutrino), so follow up experiments are built to robustly test this. MicroBooNE just reported their first test of MiniBooNE's excess and, in a different kind of experiment, they don't see it. But the MiniBooNE result has been checked to hell and back, it is pretty hard to believe that it is just an experimental problem, although it could be. Thus people are considering new physics scenarios other than sterile neutrinos and these scenarios often go under the umbrella term of dark sector, although it's a pretty shit name just like dark matter and dark energy.",Physics

714,"Biology is a very broad field. Introductory classes at university are typically vast and superficial in terms of the content. Specializing in a particular area of biology will  happen as you advance in your degree, taking more elective classes and focusing on your interests. Granted, this is how things usually work in the U.S., and I'm not sure where you are. \n\nIn the US, biologists with a bachelors degree work introductory level jobs in their field.  Many work as laboratory technicians or in other areas depending on their specialty. Advanced degrees (Masters, Doctorate) or certificates are required for more focused jobs with better pay. The coursework required to become proficient in these fields tends to be rigorous and require a lot of studying and focus. The jobs themselves have a range of salary and expectations - it's too broad of a field to get more specific than that. \n\nMajoring in biology is becoming a bit more rare as the life science field is more diverse than in previous decades. Many colleges offer different majors to accommodate this and allow students to focus on their interests and the required requisite knowledge, and become better prepared for employment in their field. If you're more interested in genetics or the body, I suggest looking into majoring in genetics or taking advanced electives in that field. Anatomy & physiology or immunology may be interesting to you as well. These courses are usually only available to those who have done well in the introductory courses that you are likely taking right now.

If you did the procedure you discuss above at a given loop-order, at the next level of the expansion, you‚Äôd have to perform another tuning, one independent of the first. QFT‚Äôs vacuum energy is radiatively unstable in the presence of classical GR. \n\nFurthermore, in saying the QFT prediction is terrible, I meant that if one wanted the 1-loop contribution to be THE dark energy, one would hope that contribution matches the observed value, or is close.

When burned, the fuel exhaust has less energy coming from a rocket that is moving quickly than it would at rest (since you subtract the rocket‚Äôs velocity from the rest exhaust velocity to get the actual exhaust velocity).

I was under the impression that nebulizer did break them down to individual atoms via vibrations or something. But the nebulizer still can make the B vitamins carry it a steam by making them as a whole into small enough particles that can be carried and absorbed, and if it gets to the LUNGS which are equipped to separate OXYGEN atoms from the other things in the air and absorb, why can't it do the same for the vitamin supplement that have other ingredients mixed in with them that are attached and then get rid of those (as it does with carbon, hydrogen etc from oxygen) and absorb the essential vitamins which your body recognizes ? But if you inject them directly without first separating all the individual ingredients  and making them into a small particle it won't work? Because once in the blood it cant separate or use enzymes to make it into a usable form particle? And also the lungs can alter PH levels. Vitamin C for example is made out of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. So your telling me the lungs won't absorb vitamin C because it has hydrogen and carbon? Doesn't the lungs absorb some carbon and hydrogen accidently?  But then again your lungs do absorb smoke and all its chemicals from cigars into blood even though it is not meant to it still does.\n\n>Why does it feel like I'm doing your homework? For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms not particles. You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against. You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another. The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible. That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur. It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process. Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting. Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules. Again at this point you are really talking chemistry more than biology. As for PH levels affecting absorption rates yes it plays a huge role but again this will be dependent upon the vitamin in question. Again this would depend on the vitamin in question, some are water soluble whereas others are oil soluble. Vibration on the molecular level is heat. Such a miniscule amount of vibration on tiny granules isn't going to do much to change them. This would be a physical change but common filler ingredient such as microcrystalline cellulose or maltodextrin are used for the aforementioned uniformity in granule size and wouldn't be affected by such vibrations but they will be broken down in your digestive system by chemical processes some as simple as being dissolved in water and other bodily fluids.",Biology

756,"I'll attempt to answer your question in the most straight forward and simplistic way I can.  I'll avoid getting too detailed so you can wrap your mind around the basic concept of viruses. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nViruses don't ""want"" anything or have goals, motives, desires or intent. Viruses exist to only to replicate. \n\nViruses are completely reliant on a host to do the replication for them. \n\nVirulence is a human created term to categorize the severity of illness caused by a viral infection. \n\nSome viruses cause little, if any, ill effect on the host.\n\nSome viruses cause the host to fall ill for prolonged periods of time. \n\nSome viruses can infect a host for the duration of the host's life. \n\nSome viruses can cause severe acute illness followed by death. \n\nSome viruses infect a host just once but leave the host forever scarred or with significant long-term health issues \n\nMany viruses are host specific, meaning they can only infect a certain specie(s).  \n\nViruses infect very specific cellular systems within the host specie(s).  \n\nThoes infected cells are ""hijacked"" by the viral genetic information and given instruction to replicate the virus over and over and over again until the infected cell bursts with millions of copies of the virus.  \n\nThe replicated viral copies quickly infect the adjoining cells and the process repeats until either all the cells are destroyed or the immune system of the host gets the viral invasion under control. \n\nMutations during the replication process drive the evolution and success of viruses. \n\nThe more the virus is able to replicate, the higher the probability of a mutation occurring. \n\nMutation are caused by errors made in the replication process.  Nearly all mutations are unsuccessful dead-ends for the virus. \n\nSome chance random mutations may make the virus more successful. \n\nA ""beneficial"" mutation may give a virus ability to replicate at a greater rate, in greater numbers, infect different cellular systems or even infect other species.\n\nWhen a virus mutates to infect a new  specie(s), it becomes a novel virus for the new host(s). \n\nA novel virus can be highly virulent on a new host because the new host has no immunity to combat the virus. \n\nA novel virus can replicate unchecked within the new host specie because there is no ""programed"" immune response to combat the novel viral infection.  \n\nWhen a virus is given the opportunity to replicate unimpeded, the probability of a successful mutations increases. \n\nAs the virus mutates through host replication, it may become more virulent on the host. \n\nIf a virus is overly virulent on its host, it often leads to an evolutionary dead end - in other words, if all the hosts are killed by a virus, the virus won't be able to replicate and will go extinct.\n\nOver time, natural selection tends to favor the mutations that make virus more transmissible over mutations that make it more virulent. \n\nThe most successful viruses are ones that have evolved to be highly transmissible but have minimal virulent effects on the host. \n\nSome viruses can be highly virulent on certain individuals in the host population and have no virulent impact on other individuals within the same population. \n\nOver time, the genetic traits in thoes unaffected individuals will be passed along to subsequent generations and become the dominant trait within the host population.  \n\nThis relationship between viruses and their hosts has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years. It's known as an evolutionary ""arms race"". \n\nViruses have always, and will continue to always be one of the selection factors driving the evolution and diversity of species on our planet.  \n\n----------------------------------\n\nAgain, I tried to make the information very simple and loose.

The aim of the experiment was to find if prolonged storage has any effect on L-ascorbic acid. I had several samples of ascorbic acid ( new, opened for week, opened for 3 months, and opened for more than  a year). I used titration method using DCPIP to found out if there are any changes. Firstly, the results show that there is more ascorbic acid than I actually used (I made a solution using 0.1g of ascorbic acid and 500ml of water, all the results show that there was more than 0.1g used which I can't explain. Secondly, I have repeated the experiment 4x and there is always an significant outlier. Also, I was doing the titration very precisely, but in some of the samples I had difficultly to find concordant titres.  Lastly, most of the results show that the older samples have more ascorbic acid in them than the new ones. I don't understand what's going on and I can't explain the results.

789,"Within the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons are part of a group of particles called leptons, which also includes the electron's heavier brothers the muon and the tauon, and their respective neutrinos. Electrons differ from muons and tauons only in mass: their charge and other fundamental properties are exactly the same.\n\nWe expect that the muon, being a heavier lepton, will decay into an electron over time, as will the tauon, which can decay into a muon or an electron. Importantly however, the Standard Model predicts that the decay rate from a tauon to an electron should be the same as the decay rate from a muon to an electron, up to a factor of their masses. As all the other properties between muons and tauons are the same, only their *mass* can affect the decay rate. This is called *lepton universality*, and it basically means that leptons only differ from each other in their mass, and interactions cannot depend on their flavor.\n\nA test of lepton universality is to take very heavy mesons, like the B meson (which contains a bottom quark), and observe its decay. B mesons will decay into K mesons by having their bottom quark decay into a strange quark, and this decay is mediated by the weak force, which allows coupling to leptons. Lepton universality then allows us to predict how many muons vs tauons we expect to see when these decays happen, and a couple of years ago we found a 2-3œÉ deviation from the theory, suggesting that lepton universality is not correct. This deviation was not large enough however to warrant a claim of ""new physics"" having been observed, for that we would need a >5œÉ detection.\n\nThe new results from LHCb repeat this 2-3œÉ deviation. It's consistent, but still not sufficient for new physics.",Physics

805,"""not influenced by internal or external stimuli"", how can anything do anything if it doesn't have a reason to?\n\nIf free will is being unfettered by things like instinct (internal stimuli) that drive me to eat when I'm hungry and avoid bodily harm (external stimuli perceived as ""danger""), then an actor with free will should be just as likely to step into traffic and die as not, with the randomness of a coin flip. I think your definition of free will is insufficient.\n\nIn AI and economics there is the concept of an agent with goals. A rational agent acts to achieve some goal (win the chess game, get the car to the destination) by choosing actions, or sequences of actions, based on their perceived utility towards achieving that goal. Things in the real world have a finite perception of the options they have and the consequences of their actions, and often even a limited conscious understanding of their own goals,  easily confusing the utility measured towards towards their final goals (??) with utility towards lesser goals instrumental towards final goals (reproduction, consuming calories in preparation for hard times, etc).\n\nMillions of years of evolution and a lifetime of social conditioning have been tweaking the way species and individuals perceive and weigh their options in different situations. I think the search for ""free will"" ultimately demands a distinction without a difference and uninteresting compared to studying biology, psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology, etc.\n\nThis is a very liberal arts degree take (as my psychology and sociology education ends at the 200 level in the New York state undergraduate system), but I like Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development as a starting point for modeling and qualifying different types of actors.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development\n\nHe distinguishes the person (often as stages of life from infancy to adulthood) who only makes choices to avoid negative stimuli (punishment, hunger), with a person who acts toward some perception of right and wrong, and from there distinguishes where they get their sense of right and wrong-- does their friend group or society dictate their morals or do they have their own moral system that they would listen to over the rules society provides.\n\nIt's very simplistic and self contradictory.

It applies about the same for flue streams as it does to atmospheric CO2, which is why I brought it up. The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn‚Äôt affect the energy required to capture it at all. \n\n(If you just feel like skimming the rest of this, see the paragraphs I say are the most important one. It provides links to journal articles which directly address what thermodynamic processes are important in determining the limits of direct air capture. One passage from one of the journal articles directly addresses and contradicts your claim.)\n\nDo you think that people who research carbon capture whether from coal/natural gas plants or from the atmosphere are just missing this very straightforward energy argument you‚Äôre making? Process chemistry analysis of the feasibility of carbon capture is done on all of these different capture environments. Have these people missed out on the apparent massive flaw in direct air capture? If you read such a paper, it even talks about energy requirements and related concerns for carbon capture. A conclusion you won‚Äôt find in this analysis is that ‚Äúcarbon capture is pointless because the energy required to capture the carbon is too high.‚Äù You can read this article (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2020.00092/full). Note the following quotation ‚ÄúBased on these studies, DAC is currently considered as an energy-intensive and costly approach for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, researchers believe that the high cost and energy consumption in such systems are mostly due to the immaturity of the technology, and hence DAC may be eventually considered as a viable option for removing CO2 from the atmosphere.‚Äù There‚Äôs no suggestion that DAC is futile because of thermodynamics restrictions. Perhaps you have a reservation about this journal (I know it‚Äôs maybe a little controversial - my main experience with it has been with a very high quality review article I read in it on a different topic though), in which case I‚Äôm sure you can find other articles on this topic in other journals, although the corresponding author‚Äôs google scholar looks legitimate enough. \n\n(These next 2 paragraphs are the most important part of my reply)\n\nYou can also check out (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00173) which is a very well cited review on direct air capture. They even have a thermodynamics section toward the end. Note that they even mention the second law of thermodynamics, but the process they are applying it to is CO2 binding to the adsorbent and then having it unbind. Citation 28 of that paper directly addresses a theoretical lower bound for the energy requirements in section 2.1. Here‚Äôs a link for a pdf of it. (https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00003926/document) The paragraphs at the start of section 2 explain how the relevant thermodynamic process doesn‚Äôt involve whatever it was that initially put the CO2 there, but rather have to do with adsorption and desorption from the material. Note how they don‚Äôt even mention the source of the CO2 in the atmosphere. \n\nThat article in citation 28 even has this quotation ‚ÄúThe ‚àº4 GJ/tC minimum may be compared to the carbon-specific energy content of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas have about 40, 50, and 70 GJ/tC respectively. Thus if the energy for air capture is provided by fossil fuels then the amount of carbon captured from the air can‚Äîin principle‚Äîbe much larger than the carbon content of the fuel used to capture it. The fuel carbon can, of course, be captured as part of the process rather than being emitted to the air.‚Äù This directly shows that your claim is incorrect. \n\nI‚Äôm not trying to be argumentative for its own sake; your claim sounded intuitive enough that I figured people might read it, think it sounded right, and then move on with a very misinformed opinion on direct air capture. In another thread on this subreddit I even saw a similar claim to the one you made being made, so it seems like others find this type of argument compelling, but I‚Äôm not sure where it‚Äôs coming from. \n\nRegarding your other point, I don‚Äôt understand why the main thing you responded to had to do with the greenhouse effect either. Obviously CO2 is a greenhouse gas. My point was that the CO2 that gets captured may or may not be in an excited vibrational state when it gets captured. Ultimately, it doesn‚Äôt even matter for the rest of the argument though. The 2 main paragraphs above show that your thermodynamic argument is incorrect with peer-reviewed journal articles.",Physics

Don't worry about the different line styles, they are details of the specific model in this paper.

Next we have a matter^1 (brown) dominated region since its energy density decreases only like a^-3 . But there is also dark energy (purple) whose energy density remains constant in time: a^0 .

Some issues to consider: how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome (not splitting important genes); ensuring regular but not too active transcription; would it lead to a sort of ""tolerance"" to the antigen, causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen. Probably much easier said than done, but hey, it's an idea.",Biology

We know that dark matter does not interact that way as there would be a huge number of 511 keV x-rays which are not seen. We also know that the dark matter self-interaction is not too large which is inconsistent with known dark matter properties. We also know that dark matter is largely invisible (does not interact with light) while anti-matter does interact with light exactly the same amount as regular matter.,Physics

With your eyes open you can see its a continuous wave propagating throughout the surface of the pond. But if you close your eyes, and put your finger just over the waters surface so that the wave barely touches it as it passes, would you still be able to tell it was a wave and not a single drop of water touching your finger?

925,"The journal doesn't normally analyse the data, they review the manuscript and the data that is presented. The way it works is that you submit a paper to a journal and the editor makes a decision on whether or not the paper should go to peer review. If yes, then the paper is sent to somewhere between one and three referees, who ideally are experts within the field, and who thoroughly scrutinize the manuscript and the presented results. That doesn't involve them re-analyzing the data, partially because that would simply be a too time consuming a process to have as a standard practice. Instead it is taken on good faith that the data was not fabricated (of course, patently absurd results would require more proof). One reason this is fine is because any result important enough to be replicated _will_ be replicated, and if other groups are unable to do so that will raise concern (which is what happened in this case). In very unique cases such as LIGO, where it's not feasible or even possible for other groups to replicate the results, more care has to be taken to ensure the authenticity of the results. In the case of LIGO, several of their recorded signals have been corroborated by radio-wave detection of the same events, which makes them more plausible.\n\nThe tl;dr is that a published article is not a stamp of truth, it's at best a stamp of rigor, but rigor is not infallible.",Physics

Other ingredients include various kinds of alcohols - methanol, ethanol, propanol - we encounter these in everyday life. They all have noticeable odours; but in low concentration the vapour isn‚Äôt something to worry about. Ethanol is the alcohol we find in wine, beer and spirits, the other alcohols are not something you should drink. Propanol is in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer. Methanol is used in fuel - but methanol is poisonous. You can find it in ‚Äòmoonshine‚Äô, that home made illicit booze. Drinking it is very risky (blindness, even death). But a faint smell of methanol is not really something to worry about. If you look at page 10 of that safety data sheet, it shows the toxic limits, but it takes some interpretation.

978,"1.The fact that he's young and healthy doesn't necessarily mean COVID won't hit him hard. Plus, the more people are vaccinated the better because the virus won't be able to transmit so easily, replicate and MUTATE. So we are more likely to get worse COVID variants if there are not enough people vaccinated. Not to mention there's a higher chance that he will spread it to his grandma or something. \n\n2. I honestly can't think how you can hit an artery in the upper arm muscle? Or even a major blood vessel.   But let's assume the vaccine goes straight into the blood stream. Nano-lipid particles are quite fragile. They're often covered in PEG to even make them stay longer in the bloodstream otherwise they would get opsonised and eaten by macrophages quickly. In order for these nano-lipids to ""enter every cell of the body"" they would have to extravasate from the blood stream and that wouldn't be so easy either (not to mention there wouldn't be enough of them to enter every cell). Usually people rely on cancer vasculature to be more ""leaky"" and try to use liposomes as drug carriers for instance. Because they would in theory accumulate in tumour. Probably the worst case scenario if by some miracle you injected the vaccine into the bloodstream would be that you might not develop an immunological memory for COVID or feel a bit worse. Even if mRNA entered some other cells, they would just start producing this spike protein. And sure, the immune cells would destroy these ""infected"" cells but there's nowhere near enough mRNA injected to cause any real damage that way (especially if it's dispersed and ""diluted"" in your body in this scenario). So essentially in the muscle the cells will start producing the spike protein (which is not secretory because some people wrongly suggest that you have a lot of this protein accumulated in your body), the immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) would find it, carry it to lymph nodes and activate T cells and B cells. There are a lot of DCs in the muscle so it's a great place to inject a vaccine. \n\n3. I honestly can't see how an mRNA vaccine can mess up your immune system and make it not work properly. It just mimicks what happens in any other viral infection. Your friend's argument is sooo general it's annoying. If he told you a suggested mechanism of action of this, then we can discuss. But like this? He should provide a source with a proof of that. \n\n4. Some people already answered. I don't really know the history of mRNA vaccine clinical trials so I won't say much. But let's not forget some companies didn't manage to make good mRNA vaccines for COVID (and tried), and that a lot of money and effort from thousands of scientist went to make these vaccines work. That for sure played a part in this success. \n\n5. I really don't like anegdotal evidence. What does it mean he ""measured""? Did this doctor actually designed a study and properly measured a correlation between a vaccination and all these diseases? And published it? If not, then his words don't mean anything.",Biology

Two differing reference frames, time, and The speed of the bullet in those reference frames, For starters.\n\nHow they get ""synced together"" (not a good phrase, but I'm going with it) isn't by doubling the speed of the bullet.  It is by using a Lorentz Transformation.  When the above posters talk about blue shifted light coming from the bullet this is related.  Due to the nature space-time warping at relativistic speeds the energies involved become a hindrance thus creating a cost for objects of mass in typical space-time system where they can't reach c.  As it creates an asymptotic energy cost to reach c.  Leaving us with a situation where it would look to the observer always less than c.  \n\nSo the observer would see, as you correctly said, the bullet travel from the gun to them in 10 seconds.  \n\nBut\n\nThe bullet would take a different time, differing reference frames and all that.  \n\nSo how do we rectify the two?  Which is where I think your question lies.  \n\nEvery time step (1 sec) light or some bit of information leaves the bullet AT the speed of light and reaches the observer.  It will always reach them first.  So, for the entire trip light is signaling the arrival of the bullet before the bullet in the bullets reference frame to the observer in the observers reference frame.  And since the bullet only goes 0.5c (and none faster) those bits of photons going c tell us the bullet never went c, regardless of how we experienced it.  \n\nLuckily we have blue shift and other measurements to tell us this rather accurately.

The second is affective empathy, which is sharing the physical experience of somebody else‚Äôs emotions. So, if somebody is feeling nervous, somebody high in affective empathy would also feel nervous. These are distinct traits. However, being high in either doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôre compassionate. Somebody could have high cognitive empathy, and just not care how others feel, or can justify their reasons for hurting others, or are supported by cultural norms or beliefs. Somebody with affective empathy might be overcome by their emotions to the point that they‚Äôre not able to be compassionate because they‚Äôre overwhelmed.\n\nFurthermore, the trouble with compassion is that we are not equally compassionate to all people in all contexts. I recall something from Sapolsky‚Äôs ‚ÄòBehave‚Äô about women who have stronger ‚Äòin groups‚Äô display more empathy among each other, but show equal fear and disdain of out groups.

1146,"Disclaimer: You are taking the very first steps of a very long road thrilled by many physicists, many of them never accepted Quantum Mecanics as a physical theory.\n\nYour thought experiment were in fact already executed several times and in different situations. There are a lot of underlying conditions you may be missing, I will give you some food for thought:\n1) Under Quantum Mechanics formalism (QM), energy conservation is not to be understood in the same way you may have under Classical Mechanics. The most striking example of this is the tunneling of particles through a potential greater than its total mechanical energy. But this is not the only one. See the Casimir force, for example;\n2) In your setup, you are probably taking your 'detectors' as perfect ones, which never miss any detection and does not give false positive. Even in a thought experiment, it is hard to conciliate this with QM formalism. Either way, supposing you have one, you are entering the 'spooky action at distance'. See the debate between Einstein and Bohr on this subject, where Einstein states what was later known as EPR paradox. I consider this a very important criticism because - although Einstein were proved wrong at the end, its questioning gave rise to a whole new field of QM, known as the QM contextuality. The first concise steps in this new field were given by Bell, which stated his famous 'inequality', I suggest you to have a try on this too;\n3) The true answer to your question is: the speed at which this 'information of detection' should travel is not relevant. What is known is that it happens as long as you adquire information about the system, you have your 'colapse'. Also, it does not violate classical energy conservation, because in the long run, i.e., in the limit where you have a long enough number of trials, total energy will be conserved. If you search for the arguments and references I've mentioned in step 2, you will inevitably end in the so called 'Hidden Variables Theory', which is in fact the begining of the contextuality problem.",Physics

1158,"This is a new proposal, fresh on the arXiv today, from a group of U.S. particle physicists. The introduction is very readable and lays out the mission clearly:\n\n> We can now confidently claim that the ‚ÄúStandard Model‚Äù of particle physics (SM) is established. At the same time, we are more and more strongly persuaded that this SM is incomplete. [...] It is now common to describe the SM as an ‚Äúeffective‚Äù theory that should be derived from some more fundamental theory at higher energies. But we have almost no evidence on the properties of that theory.\n\n> Our successes have become a liability in reaching this goal. Scientists from other fields now have the impression that particle physics is a finished subject. They question our motivations to go on to explore still higher energies. The scale of an energy frontier collider is also challenging to the young people in our field. They need to see qualitatively new capabilities realized during their active scientific careers. [...] That is where the urgency lies.\n\n> [T]he entire C3 program could be sited in the United States. With the cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider and the end of Tevatron operations the US has largely abandoned construction of domestic accelerators at the energy frontier. C3 offers the opportunity to realize an affordable energy frontier facility in the US. This may be crucial to realize a Higgs factory in the near term, and it will also position the US to lead the drive to the next, higher energy stage of exploration.\n\nThe main innovation is that they propose to use _non_-superconducting cavities, which allow much higher accelerating fields, cooled to increase their quality factor. The resulting shorter length dramatically decreases the cost, to an estimated $4 billion, which is 80% to 90% less than other proposals. Of course, $4 billion is no small amount of money, but for perspective that's about equal to the monthly budget of the National Institutes of Health, a third of the cost of the James Webb Space Telescope, or 2% of the total cost of the space shuttle.",Physics

1169,">The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn‚Äôt affect the energy required to capture it at all.\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.   \n\nWhether any and all of this is done by burning fossil fuels (to generate the problem) and running renewably powered CO2-harvesters (to fix it) such as the prototype in Iceland, OR by decomposing plant and animal matter over thousands of years (the problem) and growing plants and algae (the fix) -- regardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back.  Whether this is done by just letting the winds blow over your adsorbant for 100 000 years, or by the flora growing for a 10 000, or by some array of turbines circling the planet and run by solar power for a thousand --- doesn't matter at all.  The fact remains that to reverse an irreversible process, you'll be spending at least the same amount of energy (and in practice, usually, much, much more). \n\nThere are many things that go into that confidence, understanding of the laws of thermodynamic being one, the ""sadly"" minute concentration of CO2 another (it would be much, much easier to process the N2 of our atmosphere, for example) -- we can even get to those if you like, but we simply *must* get around the *same* table before its even worthwhile.

The more we study things, the more we find there are natural explanations for them.\n\nHere is a [great post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/studying-near-death-experiences/) from a neurologist on NDEs (excerpt below)\n\n>That NDEs occur is not controversial ‚Äì many people report remembering experiences around the time of cardiac arrest from which they were revived. Typical experiences include a sense of floating outside of one‚Äôs body, even looking down upon oneself and the events going on. Some people report a bright light, and others report ‚Äúpassing over‚Äù and being greeted by deceased loved-ones. The experience is often peaceful or euphoric, which contrasts to the way people feel when they eventually wake up. Surviving a cardiac arrest takes its toll and is not a pleasant experience.\n\n>The question is not whether or not people have such experiences ‚Äì the question is how to interpret them. Just as even the most rigorous skeptic does not question that people see UFOs, but rather what the UFOs likely are.\n\n>The burden of proof for anyone claiming that NDEs are evidence for the survival of the self beyond the physical function of the brain is to rule out other more prosaic explanations. This burden has not been met.\n\n>Neuroscientists are piecing together plausible explanations for each of the components of the NDE. The sensation of floating outside one‚Äôs body can be reliably induced by suppressing that part of the brain that makes us feel as if we possess our bodies. The experience is identical to that reported by those who have had an NDE. This experience can be replicated by drugs or magnetic stimulation. There are even reports (I have had one such patient) of people who have a typical NDE experience during seizures. The bright light can be explained as a function of hypoxia (relative lack of oxygen) either to the retina or the visual cortex. Any everything else is simply the culturally appropriate hallucinations of a hypoxic brain.",Biology

Liquid nitrogen is supplied out of this tank, from an outlet at the bottom of the tank. No pump, just liquid decant/gravity fed out. I understand the liquid at the outlet is subject to a force according to the height of liquid above it (and density, gravity). \n\n- To what degree does the 1000kpa of pressure in the vapour space affect the liquid that is 'pushed out' the bottom outlet? Does this pressure apply a force on liquid below the surface at all? \n- if we consider the liquid level height and the vapour pressure as variables, which will be a more significant factor in how 'quickly', or with how much force the liquid is pushed out the bottom?\n\nIt's been a few years since uni and I'm trying to wrap my head around it.

1184,"This it not something I am an expert at, it's just my current understanding: \n\n**Conjugation** is the transfer of genetic material through touch. In Bacteria this is a very small bit of naked DNA that travels through a specialized appendage. The conjugation process of the eukaryote *Paramecium* is different because like all ciliates *Paramecium* has two nuclei, a large and a small, and during conjugation the small nucleus undergoes meiosis and haploid small nuclei are exchanged with the mate. Conjugation in the *Paramecium* results in genetic variation, but does not result in additional organisms, so it is *sexual* but it is not *reproductive*.\n\n**Plasmogamy** is the fusion of the protoplasm of two cells (they share a cell membrane) without a nuclear fusion, and I think it is generally used to describe Fungi. My understanding is plasmogamy in fungi (resulting in the dikaryotic cell) is always ultimately followed by a delayed karyogamy. From what I can tell, the process by which *Paramecium* trades nuclei involves plasmogamy as well, but I don't see the word used in that context, so maybe there is some subtlety I am not aware of, or a preferred synonym. More on this below.\n\n**Karyogamy** is the fusion of nuclei.\n\n**Syngamy** is the fusion of two haploid gametes to form a diploid cell (it is called fertilization in some organisms). Plasmogamy and karyogamy are stage 1 and 2 of syngamy and typically progress quickly except in dikaryotic fungi.\n\nPlasmodial slime molds hatch as unicellular amoebas which are haploid gametes (well, sometimes...) and when two sexually compatible amoebas meet they fuse their cytoplasm (plasmogamy) and nuclei (karyogamy) together to become a diploid cell (syngamy), then repeatedly divide their nuclei without cell division to grow to a macroscopic size. To my knowledge, slimes do not perform conjugation, but I have seen that terminology used in older papers. Unfortunately it is not always clear when a scientific term is being used to describe analogous or unrelated processes. Part of the problem with terminology is words can have drastically different definitions in different fields, or even in the same field. ""Guttation"" exists in plants, fungi, and slimes but is not an analogous process, for example. ""Conjugation"" likewise describes two very different processes in bacteria and ciliate eukaryotes. And so plasmogamy, karyogamy, and syngamy may not describe identical processes in different types of organisms, or may be replaced by other synonyms. Hopefully someone with more knowledge can add to this.",Biology

The point is to have an adsorbent that is selective for CO2 over other atmospheric gases. \n\nHere are two examples explaining why I don‚Äôt think your analysis is correct. First, rather than direct air capture people are working on capturing CO2 from a coal or natural gas flue stream. As mentioned in my previous comment, a coal plant will produce a good deal more CO2 than a natural gas plant will for the same amount of energy generated, but this actually doesn‚Äôt matter so much for the point I‚Äôm trying to make besides making it likely that you would want a different adsorbent material for the the two cases. If what you‚Äôre saying is correct, this work would be a completely pointless endeavor. In order to capture the CO2 from the fossil fuel plants, you would have to generate as much energy as they are generating with renewables. There would be no reason to do this if you were correct, yet this is a very active area of research that gets funding from the DOE and other sources. This is more of ‚Äúproof by authority‚Äù than actually addressing your point with a physical argument, but I mention this because it‚Äôs one of the main reasons that I initially was skeptical of your claim. There are likely many hundreds or thousands of scientists currently working on, evaluating, and funding this type of research that your apparently simple argument based on the second law of thermodynamics renders pointless. It seems unlikely to me that so many people just haven‚Äôt considered this claim, especially since process modeling on the economic and materials cost of these materials is common as well and in that type of modeling, they develop sophisticated thermodynamic and kinetic models of CO2 capture in specific materials. They wouldn‚Äôt continue doing this if it were as simple as just having to input as much energy as you initially got out since then it would be a pointless task. \n\nThe second example is one I alluded to in my previous comment. Suppose in one case that all of our historical emissions were from coal plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_c. Suppose in another case that all of our emissions were from natural gas plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_n. In both cases there would be the same amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but E_n > E_c since natural gas emits less CO2 than coal for the same amount of energy generated.  By your argument, in these two scenarios, we would have to generate different amounts of energy to capture this carbon dioxide. This doesn‚Äôt make sense, however. Once the carbon dioxide is in the air, it doesn‚Äôt matter how it got there. We aren‚Äôt trying to turn the CO2 back into coal or back into natural gas. Instead we are trying to get it to bind to some material, and the energy required to make the material and unbind the CO2 later (if that‚Äôs required for storing it underground) will be fixed for the same material capturing CO2 from the atmosphere, regardless of the source of the CO2 initially. The material doesn‚Äôt care if the CO2 came from coal or a fire or from a person breathing. \n\nTo address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. After absorbing light it doesn‚Äôt permanently stay in an excited state. \n\nYour fart example misses the point again. The point of carbon capture isn‚Äôt to end up with coal or natural gas or whatever else as a byproduct of CO2 capture. The point is going from coal -> CO2 (and other things) -> CO2 bound to some material. It isn‚Äôt trying to make something a reversible process.",Physics

They are usually going to be very cheap materials with no real life time.  Any one of these materials can react badly to one of your chemicals.

Pick one that suits your needs and put a label on it.  Only use it for that chemical.\n\nFor instance, a brass nozzle will definitely survive some chemicals forever but 100% die within seconds for other chemicals.\n\nThe cheap hack for low-budget cleaners is to use the original packaging.

1564,"The same set of nine essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) are common to all animals, as far I know. In other words, sometime after a heterotrophic lifestyles developed in the pre-Cambrian, key enzymes in those metabolic pathways were lost, probably when our ancestors were single celled protists. Once those critters started eating other critters, there was no selection to conserve those chains of enzymes in the metabolic pathways.\n\nHumans can still synthesize the other proteinogenic amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, tyrosine) from other metabolic precursors, though perhaps not at levels ideal for human health. [Glycine](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/033/05/0771-0780) is of some interest here.\n\n\> Does the body know the difference\n\nYes. Some amino acids serve important signaling functions. For example, the most common essential amino acid, leucine, plays a key role in satiety and in telling individual cells whether they should adopt a anabolic (make stuff) or catabolic (recycle trash) tone. In both cases this is via the remarkable metabolic regulator [MTOR](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=mtor&as_occt=title) (mammalian target of rapamycin).\n\n\> Are these then stored or flushed through the lymphatic, on to elimination systems?\n\nNope. Each individual cell largely is its own factory, responsible for grabbing what it needs from the bloodstream, and discarding what it doesn't via bloodstream. Excess amino acids get excreted via the kidneys.\n\n\> Any good books on the subject?\n\nI have a batchelor's in biochemistry, so I'm not deterred by the jargon, but learned almost nothing about nutrition in my school days. For those with a scientific background like yourself, I'd recommend academic textbooks, like [Modern nutrition in health and disease](https://1lib.us/book/3484357/f6767f).

1566,"Consider any point along the rope. The question now is, how is air resistance and gravity affecting the rope beneath it? That determines in which direction the rope beneath that point is pulling that point on the rope.\n\nWell, gravity is proportional to the mass of that length of rope, which is proportional to the length of the rope.\n\nAir resistance is proportional to the wind-facing surface area of the rope, which is *also* proportional to the length of the rope.\n\nSince these are both proportional to length, as you move down the rope, neither the downward effect of gravity or the approximately horizontal effect of air resistance is able to pull ahead, and the rope is just pulled in the same direction for the entire length.\n\n----\n\nHere is a more mathematically rigorous explanation:\n\nConsider an arbitrary length of the rope.\n\nIgnoring other attached segments of rope (which should behave identically), and thus their tension forces, there are two forces acting on the rope: gravity, and air resistance.\n\nNet air resistance is proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's wind-facing area is proportional to its length.\n\nNet gravitational force is *also* proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's mass is proportional to its length.\n\nThus, the net force is given by:\n\n- **F**_net = **F**_a + **F**_g = L\***f**_a + L\***f**_g = L\*(**f**_a + **f**_g)\n\nwhere **F**_a and **F**_g are air resist. and gravity, L is rope length, and **f**_a and **f**_g are the ""per-length"" air resist. and gravity forces.\n\nSince the rope is of uniform mass, **f**_g is constant for the entire rope, since gravity is approximately constant along the whole rope, which is short compared to the size of the Earth.\n\nIf we assume approximately constant air velocity and air density/makeup around the entire length of the rope, then we also get that **f**_a is constant for the entire rope.\n\nSince **f**_a and **f**_g are constant for the whole rope, so is there sum. This means that we have:\n\n- **F**_net = L\***k**\n\nwhere **k** = **f**_a + **f**_g is a constant vector.\n\nAll this math has resulted in the above equation, which alone tells us the rope should be straight and look like (B). The net force for every segment of rope along the rope, before accounting for tension forces, is in the same direction. When you add tension forces, those will only act parallel or anti-parallel to this net force.\n\nThus, the net force along the entire rope will be parallel to a constant direction, which is a straight line.",Physics
