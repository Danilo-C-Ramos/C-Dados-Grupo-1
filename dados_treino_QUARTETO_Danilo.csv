"A decent chunk of it is angular momentum. When things spin they resist any change in their vector (more or less), or an acceleration. This is my guns are rifled. The bullet spins and it has a straighter trajectory. It is angular momentum that keeps a bicycle upright. This is really simplified, but I think it gets the point across.\n\nCheck out this video that shows how the path of a football changes with spin: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMD1tJI9AWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMD1tJI9AWE)\n\nWhat you have stumbled upon is that the reason gyroscopes work is because of their angular momentum. There is an experiment/demonstration with a spinning bicycle wheel ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaauRiRX4do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaauRiRX4do)). When the wheel is spinning trying to change its direction creates a Newton's 3rd Law force pair. If you do this experiment on an office chair you can actually spin yourself around just be trying to tilt the wheel ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cRb0xvPJ2M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cRb0xvPJ2M)).\n\nRealistically, it's a bit more complex than that (ie spinning changes the aerodynamics), but I think this gives you an idea of the physics behind it and should lead you into some further investigation.",Physics

"Notice that the mean velocity is **Vmean=(1/2)(Vi+Vf)**, so that from your formula **Δx = Vmean*t** (which is probably the formula that you know for a body moving with constant velocity).\n\nThis means that someone moving at a constant speed **Vmean**, will travel the same distance in the same period of time as someone accelerating from **Vi** to **Vf**.\n\nAnother way to prove this is: If a body moves with constant acceleration **a**, then its displacement is given by **Δx=Vi t + (1/2) a t^2**. The final velocity is given by **Vf=Vi+a t**. From this last equation, you get **a=(Vf-Vi)/t**. Replacing this into the displacement equation, you get **Δx= (1/2) (Vf+Vi) t**.",Physics

Your blood cells inherit their DNA from these stem cells.\n\nIf there's something wrong with your marrow (or your blood) and you require a transplant, you've now got someone else's blood stem cells sitting in your bones, making new blood cells. The new blood cells will inherit their DNA from the stem cells that made them, so now you also have blood cells with the donor's DNA in them. This doesn't mean all of the DNA in your body is replaced, it just means your blood in particular is now a genetic mix of cells containing your own DNA (which your own marrow made) and cells containing the donor's DNA (which the donated marrow made).\n\nThis is true for any organ transplant, by the way. If you receive a kidney transplant, the DNA in that kidney doesn't change to match yours.

"Without realistic waste recycling it is a non-starter.\n\nWe made a fundamental mistake in the 1950s. We ran military reactors at Oak Ridge and Hanford to produce plutonium for weapons. This eliminated the incentive to recycle waste from commercial reactors. That led to the unsustainable policy of storing waste on-site.\n\nFrance, Russia and the Uk recycle spent fuel rods greatly reducing yhw waste which needs to be stored and extending the life of the fuel.\n\nWe could adopt the French system which is less susceptible to catastrophe like Fukushima or  Chernobyl or Three Mile Island.\n\nWe could go over to thorium reactors but that would involve total retooling of the Industry. \n\nNone of this will happen because there is too much private capital at risk.

"If you want better answers you need to ask better questions.  Im not trying to be condescending but you would do yourself a huge favor by getting a better grasp on chemistry before trying to grasp molecular biology.  At this point you are asking things that are explained in middle school science classes before they even call the class chemistry, or at least my middle school called it Science class.  A gas has atoms less densely packed than a liquid or solid.  A nebulizer  uses an atomizer to disperse the drug and in turn and intrinsically turns it into a gas or at least decreases the droplet size small enough to be inhaled without choking.  The less mass something has the less effect gravity has on it.  Something under about 80nm is uneffected by gravity.  Although the droplets are larger than this they do have such little mass at those sizes that they are temporarily suspended in air.  This is essentially a fog not steam.  Of course steam is acting on similar principles and is also lifted into the air by thermodynamics. Speaking of your earlier example of liquids those are suspensions in liquids usually mostly water with some flavoring to make it easier to swallow whereas a nebulizer or inhaler is a suspension in air. Gases mix homogeneously without even mixing like a liquid.  At this point it is getting a bit difficult to explain to you because you are requiring an explanation of underpinnings that should be understood and implied.  Again see basic chemistry and physics.

The glucose created by gluconeogenesis would be identical to the glucose you consume (Glucose is glucose). However the things that happen to the glucose would be different. \n\nSo regardless of where your glucose comes from TECHNICALLY they can be stored as glycogen, however, gluconeogenesis generally only occurs if your body is in starvation mode as your fuel stores will be running low, or your blood-glucose concentration will drop to dangerous levels. \n\nUnder these circumstances the body has no incentive to start synthesising glycogen stores from glucose as your body would much rather be breaking down the glycogen stores to mobilise glucose to increase the blood-glucose concentrations back to the normal levels, or it can be further broken down for fuel.",Biology

"Don't try to memorize everything, it's a fool's errand. Try to really grasp the fundamental topics and then you should be able to draw connections between them. Some people like to use a concept map to visually see the connections between different topics. \n\nI don't really remember what was covered in general bio, but some fundamental topics you *might* want to become familiar with are the central dogma (DNA->RNA->Protein), cell signalling, inheritance/Mendelian genetics, natural selection, and differences between bacteria and eukaryotes.

Very dependent on the enzyme but im gonna say not exactly.\n\nYou gotta understand theres a lot more than a single nano particle and that theres a lottttttt more than single strands of DNA in a nanoparticle. If you shine some radiation on a sample it wont homogenously effect each bit of DNA the same and many will go unscathed.\n\nAt that some modifications of DNA are going to be much more detrimental to DNA binding than others. Add in the fact that theres varying binding specificity and your enzyme you pick will matter. Some are super specific and wont bind if theres a change while others will bind to anything resembling DNA.\n\nTo have enough radiation to confidentally effect every bit of DNA in a nanoparticle youll also be messing up the tissue that its in. Proteins will also be messed up in the process for instance.\n\nIf the DNA containing lipid nanoparticles were separate from the tissue/enzyme to begin with and you treated it to a prolonged exposure to radiation before adding the nanoparticles to a culture/reaction  mix then sure tho,Biology

You would see strange, stable isotopes that never occur in nature.\n\nIf you increase the electron density even further, you would start to see muons in the chamber.

"Start simple. \n\nModelling things like this usually involves calculating the result numerically because the analytic results can get out of hand quickly. \n\nThe simplest numerical method is finite difference on a regular grid - you're essentially sampling the field at the grid points. Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.",Physics

I think it would be far more effective for mankind to focus on restoring ecosystems and reducing our CO2 emissions rather then try to brute force engineer our way out of the problem. The planet we live on provides a huge amount of life support for free. It would be a mistake to focus human economic output on replacing a system that was naturally correcting and required no maintenance with systems that require constant maintenance and support from who knows how many humans who could instead be focusing their work output on things that the planet can not do for us such as building infrastructure in space focused on spreading our reach to resources beyond our planet in order to put even less stress on planet earth over time.\n\nPlanet earth is a marvel. When you look at the difficulties of living on any other planet but this one you are blown away by how much we get for absolutely free. This free life support system is the most valuable thing (to humanity) in the entire universe. We must repair it and humans might not ever discover anything like our planet even if we explore significant chunks of the milky way.,Physics

"I often see posts like this,\n\nThere is a lot of anxiety in people about ""chemicals"". Be it lead in tinned food, cyanide in almonds, passive smoke vapour from cigarettes.

You can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds (you'd have to eat astronomical amounts). There are cases of people overdosing on bananas (potassium has radioactive isotopes). What I'm getting at is there are things you should worry about, and things you shouldn't. And this is firmly in the ""don't need to worry about"" category.\n\nMuch bigger health concerns: smoking, drinking, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise. \n\nNow this may be a totally innocent ""rabbit hole"" you've gone down.

Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",Chemistry

"In this visualization, I show the wavefront propagation of a coherent light beam (i.e., a simple laser) after passing through a holographic film, on where I previously recorded the relative information corresponding to the phase and amplitude of the object to be reproduced.\n\nPrecisely, the recorded film needs to reproduce the Fourier transform of the object up to an arbitrary phase factor.\n\nAn experimental technique for recording the hologram is interferometry; that is, a second wavefront, mutually coherent with the first and of known amplitude and phase, is added to the wavefront produced by illuminating the object we want to reconstruct. The holograms can also be entirely generated by a computer, like the ones shown here.\n\nThe standard recording material for the holographic film is a silver halide emulsion. Spatial light modulators, which are based on a LCD, can be used for creating real-time varying holograms. Finally, with the advent of nanofabrication techniques, today we can also create metasurfaces to do the task and mold optical wavefronts into almost any arbitrary profile over several wavelengths.\n\nThis technique can be used as well for displaying an arbitrary 3D object, but for a more quality reconstruction, a bit more complex setup is going to be required, for example, by performing oblique illumination on the holographic film.\n\n[The source code I implemented for propagating the wavefront and creating the holograms can be found here.](https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Diffraction-Simulations--Angular-Spectrum-Method)\n\nHappy Halloween to everyone 🎃",Physics

The city I live in has three MPIs. I don’t work at one of those, but I do a PhD in physics in a similar institute. One of the other PhDs in my group did his master in the MPI on the other side of the road. He says working there was nice, but you need a proper work ethic (which you need anyway for a PhD). \nIn general, before starting a PhD you should find out who your direct supervisor is and who the professor you’re going to work under is. From my experience that’s often not the same person in the bigger institutes. So it’s good to make sure you can work with both of them. I would also recommend that you only start a PhD in a topic that really, really fascinates and intrigues you. Don’t start a PhD in something that has good job prospects but that doesn’t interest you. You will hate yourself for it a year in ;)\n\nGenerally MPIs have more money than university research groups (average, and I am speaking about German universities) so MPIs tend to have nice equipment. Payment is set according to the union Tarif for public institutions. Just the fraction of work time that you will be payed for can differ (mostly from 50% pay to 75%).

"There's a couple of reasons, first the common cold isn't a single virus, it's not even a single family of viruses so having immunity to one causal virus just reduces the number of common cold causing viruses that can infect you.  Another is that not all viruses are remembered equally.  Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection, just in time to pick it up again the next winter.  This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.  Fourth would be you're immune system is compromised, perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immuno-suppressant or had viral infection, like measles, which wipes out your immune memory.",Biology

"Actually, u/Adventurous_Yam_2852 is correct. Giving testosterone (T) as part of transgender transition from female to male is *very* different from giving T to adult cis males to alter voice. \n\nThe first one raises T from very low (female normal) to high (male normal), similarly to the change in puberty, while the second would be a much smaller increase (if at safe levels). So, the proper comparison with trying to lower voices of cis male adults with more T would be trying to *further* lower voices of trans men *after* their transition -- something known not to either work or be safe.\n\nGiving a large T increase to adult cis males to lower voices might work (I don't know but doubt it), but would definitely carry important long-term health risks including high cardiovascular health risks, blood pressure increase, certain types of feminization (as the body tries to rebalance by increasing estrogen), testicular atrophy and more.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

"Welcome to this puzzling problem set\n\nI am currently doing a reaction in the lab, where I am working with a molecule that contains the moiety shown above.\n\nUpon treatment with base (Carbonate Buffer at ph 9 and 10 as well as in DMF with DIPEA) there are peaks/masses appearing on the LCMS and also it seems like the cleavage of the Thioester just stagnates after a certain point.\n\nIt took me a while to develop ideas what byproducts these masses on the LCMS could belong to\n\n**a:** shows the molecule before treatment with base. This mass also appears after treatment with base which I find quite confusing because I would expect the thioester to be completely broken up\n\n**b:** shows the molecule upon treatment: the thioester is cleaved and the thiol is freed (I also see the mass of the disulfide of b)\n\n**c:** shows the mass of my product without the acetyl-protecting group on the amine. This is something I find super surprising – why should the acetyl be cleaved off? It's an amide, so…super stable? I know what you are about to say: maybe it's just something that happens in the LCMS through ionization! 1. there was an extra peak for this mass in the UV and molecule e also kinda proves that c really exists.  \nAlso, I expect **c** to undergo an S-N acyl shift, so I would obtain an amide and a free cysteine (**shown in d**). They do have the same mass\n\n**e** would be the disulfide formed between the free Thiol of b and d. Upon addition of TCEP to the mixture this mass vanished. This would also prove the S-N acyl shift theory\n\nSo:  1. why is there deacetylation happening in the first place?\n\nAnd here comes the biggest question mark: I have 3 substrates, they all look quite similar to a except they don’t have an acetyl-protected amine (they don't have an amine close to this position at all). Still, they all show these weird rearrangement (or whatever) masses. This would speak for another part of the molecule participating in these side reactions. (the structures drawn above are just interpretations of the masses based on the original molecule)\n\nDo you have any other suggestions about what could happen? Is there another shift I don’t know of between Amides and thioesters?

"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",Biology

"I think the emergent property argument, at least as I’ve heard Sean Carroll say in other contexts, is something similar to how physicists view emergent properties in statistical mechanics. That is to say, there is no such thing as the temperature of a single atom, nor the pressure of a single atom, but rather these macroscopic properties (of a gas, say) can be very accurately modeled as emerging from the many trillions of well-understood kinetic collisions of those atoms. In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we’ve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don’t fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology

The neutrons in this experiment are ""ultacold neutrons"" (E < a few hundred neV) so 10B has a very high capture cross section. The capture reaction is 10B (n,alpha) 7Li.\n\nThe detector is built like a sandwich. On the outer edges are ~20 nm of 10B. The interior layer is ZnS, a scintillator. In the middle there is acrylic that has wavelength-shifting fibers (WLSF) built into it. From left to right, the structure is 10B : ZnS : acrylic and WLSF : ZnS : 10B.\n\nWhen a neutron captures on 10B either an alpha or a 7Li passes through the ZnS, and the scintillation light is gathered into the WLSF. The WLSF carry the light to the PMTs, and from there the signal can be digitized. One key feature of this detector is that the WLSF are laid out in alternating fashion, so adjacent WLSF transmit light to different PMTs. This allows for us to look for coincident signals between two PMTs, which significantly suppresses (and more importantly, stabilizes!) background noise from ~250 Hz to ~0.5 Hz.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics

With your eyes open you can see its a continuous wave propagating throughout the surface of the pond. But if you close your eyes, and put your finger just over the waters surface so that the wave barely touches it as it passes, would you still be able to tell it was a wave and not a single drop of water touching your finger?

Plants only or what?) but I will try to answer your question in a general manner.\n\nOne potential reason why species diversity may boost oxygen availability is that some plants may be complimented by other plants providing nutrients they themselves cannot make, thus allowing them to grow faster and thus produce more oxygen as byproducts of their metabolism. Some animal species may consume herbivores and potentially increase the amount of primary producers within the ecosystem or these animals might help disperse the plants to previously unexploited locations that are conducive to primary producer productivity.",Biology

"Sorry if I was brief above, but you just told the wrong narrative. The contribution cancellation you describe may hold at any given loop-order in the perturbative expansion of the vacuum energy coming from QFT. The problem with gravity is that it’s non-renormalizable. If you did the procedure you discuss above at a given loop-order, at the next level of the expansion, you’d have to perform another tuning, one independent of the first. QFT’s vacuum energy is radiatively unstable in the presence of classical GR. \n\nFurthermore, in saying the QFT prediction is terrible, I meant that if one wanted the 1-loop contribution to be THE dark energy, one would hope that contribution matches the observed value, or is close. Due to the mismatch, one has to rely on a fine tuning which then removes the ability to predict the vacuum energy.\n\nFinally, this all assumes that DE is a cosmological constant (cc), which isn’t actually required by the data. There are different manners of obtaining the current expansionary behavior (and its implied source).",Physics

"> spirit of this sub,\n\nClassifications in Biology range from the extremely specific to the incredibly vague. For example, it could identify a young male Blue Tit as, well, that, *or* simply a member of the animal kingdom. Each name and group is derived from the group before it and could not exist without a predecessor.\n\nTherefore, if we do *not* have vague classifactions of nature, we have ignored what our specific names were built off of, we have disrespected the history and hard work of many a biologist before us.\n\nAs such, since many other subs have the specifics down on naming things better than us already, it should be up to us to give vague classifications for the very sake of biology. As long as we remain technically correct, we will have likely fulfilled this goal.\n\nSo it could be said (after jumping through many mental hoops) that it is in the spirit of this sub to be vague about this as long as the other ID subs exist.\n\nNot that anyone much cares, it seems.",Biology

When the protons of the atoms of your cell walls disintegrate the energy released will continue on, eternal and indestructible. Energy is a pool, the universe is rock that’s been thrown in, the oscillating ripples across the surface is time. Everything; you, a car horn, the moon, your phone, are just different types of ripples pulsing through the pool. They will fade and then the pool will become still. But don’t let appearances fool you; this stillness is *perfectly* disordered and chaotic. Energy will become spread out to such an extent where it is unable to interact with itself: *maximum entropy*. Eventually all of the ripples of the universe, will fade. Energy has reached its only goal: a state of maximum entropy. The pool will then become a paradox: perfectly calm yet perfectly chaotic, waiting for something new to be thrown in.",Chemistry

With great precision they could tell you when and where you’re going to see Jupiter or Venus in the sky. But if you ask them what those objects in the sky were, they couldn’t tell you because they didn’t know. The more I learn about this topic the more I realize that not much has changed since Feynman gave that talk.

I suspect it has something to do with convection in the wax vs. on its surface, where convection in the wax causes motion in the direction of the flame, while local convection occurring in the air surrounding the flame creates an opposing velocity field on the surface of the wax. It seems like there’s vortices in the vertical plane (i.e. the plane the wick lies in) that are creating the attracting-repelling effect.",Physics

"Well pardon me for still not understanding because im a real basic cyclist and high school physics person. But I have noticed in my observation there seems to be nothing related to counterbalancing the shift in the center of gravity. Remember the weight is always on the left handlebar. See your answer starts off with me tilting right to correct the center of gravity BUT the very instant i lift my hands off the handlebars from a well balanced moving bicycle, i can feel the bike start to progressively tilt right. It’s kind of like I feel an invisible force pulling me to the right\n\nEven more interestingly, i could tilt my body left first, while still holding the handlebar to balance, then lift my hands off and the bicycle will continue to cycle straight perfectly balanced. If i start off perfectly balanced and lift my hands off then the bicycle will start tilting to the right which after a set amount of tilt, I will start responding and leaning my body to the left to counter the tilt\n\nConsider this similar observation I made as well, when cycling without hands, if strong wind comes at me at 90 degrees from my right to left, my bike starts tilting right against the wind. These are all too counterintuitive for me to understand what is going on",Physics

"I'll attempt to answer your question in the most straight forward and simplistic way I can.  I'll avoid getting too detailed so you can wrap your mind around the basic concept of viruses. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nViruses don't ""want"" anything or have goals, motives, desires or intent. Viruses exist to only to replicate. \n\nViruses are completely reliant on a host to do the replication for them. \n\nVirulence is a human created term to categorize the severity of illness caused by a viral infection. \n\nSome viruses cause little, if any, ill effect on the host.\n\nSome viruses cause the host to fall ill for prolonged periods of time. \n\nSome viruses can infect a host for the duration of the host's life. \n\nSome viruses can cause severe acute illness followed by death. \n\nSome viruses infect a host just once but leave the host forever scarred or with significant long-term health issues \n\nMany viruses are host specific, meaning they can only infect a certain specie(s).  \n\nViruses infect very specific cellular systems within the host specie(s).  \n\nThoes infected cells are ""hijacked"" by the viral genetic information and given instruction to replicate the virus over and over and over again until the infected cell bursts with millions of copies of the virus.  \n\nThe replicated viral copies quickly infect the adjoining cells and the process repeats until either all the cells are destroyed or the immune system of the host gets the viral invasion under control. \n\nMutations during the replication process drive the evolution and success of viruses. \n\nThe more the virus is able to replicate, the higher the probability of a mutation occurring. \n\nMutation are caused by errors made in the replication process.  Nearly all mutations are unsuccessful dead-ends for the virus. \n\nSome chance random mutations may make the virus more successful. \n\nA ""beneficial"" mutation may give a virus ability to replicate at a greater rate, in greater numbers, infect different cellular systems or even infect other species.\n\nWhen a virus mutates to infect a new  specie(s), it becomes a novel virus for the new host(s). \n\nA novel virus can be highly virulent on a new host because the new host has no immunity to combat the virus. \n\nA novel virus can replicate unchecked within the new host specie because there is no ""programed"" immune response to combat the novel viral infection.  \n\nWhen a virus is given the opportunity to replicate unimpeded, the probability of a successful mutations increases. \n\nAs the virus mutates through host replication, it may become more virulent on the host. \n\nIf a virus is overly virulent on its host, it often leads to an evolutionary dead end - in other words, if all the hosts are killed by a virus, the virus won't be able to replicate and will go extinct.\n\nOver time, natural selection tends to favor the mutations that make virus more transmissible over mutations that make it more virulent. \n\nThe most successful viruses are ones that have evolved to be highly transmissible but have minimal virulent effects on the host. \n\nSome viruses can be highly virulent on certain individuals in the host population and have no virulent impact on other individuals within the same population. \n\nOver time, the genetic traits in thoes unaffected individuals will be passed along to subsequent generations and become the dominant trait within the host population.  \n\nThis relationship between viruses and their hosts has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years. It's known as an evolutionary ""arms race"". \n\nViruses have always, and will continue to always be one of the selection factors driving the evolution and diversity of species on our planet.  \n\n----------------------------------\n\nAgain, I tried to make the information very simple and loose.  I left our a tremendous amount of information in hopes to provide some insight without confusion.",Biology

"Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor or researcher, and I haven't read anything about ibuprofen vs. COVID vaccines, but I'll take a stab at it:\n\nInflammation (aches, soreness) is part of the human body's immune response to infection or vaccines. Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory, and thus might work to lessen the inflammation triggered by the vaccine (maybe, I dunno for sure).\n\nIbuprofen wears off fairly quick, so any anti-inflammatory action should be short-lived. Ideally. But taking more ibuprofen is something to be wary of. \n\nDid you completely negate the vaccine with one dose of ibuprofen? Unlikely (but I don't know for sure). The immune response consists of more than just inflammation (white blood cell recruitment, memory-cell generation) that takes a while to generate maximum protection (two weeks for full effect). My **guess** is taking ibuprofen for one out of fourteen days wouldn't make much difference. \n\nIf someone wants to correct me, and/or link to studies of vaccines and ibuprofen, please feel free.",Biology

"Industrial medicinal chemistry here, not in the US but there'll be some commonalities.\n\nYou'd start doing synthetic organic chemistry while they teach you the med chem, the chemistry is often simpler and less cutting edge than what you're probably doing for your PhD but the priority is getting the compound out for testing as fast as possible. There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data. For me, getting the data back on something you designed or made and seeing it progress through the assays is a really fun part of the job.\n\nEquipment and time-saving kit are more readily available. Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it. Industry loves new technology and will often invest in it quite heavily. More time is spent on admin and meetings than in academia, and there are far more rules and policies to follow.\n\nSalary is usually pretty good and should be much better than a PhD stipend, most companies have bonuses and stock options too. Careers development again depends on the company but large firms are usually quite good at helping you develop your career the way you want to, such as specialising in synthesis, med chem or people management. Hours will depend on the company culture - some of my US colleagues work quite long days, but on the whole it's likely to be less hours than a PhD.",Chemistry

What I've said in this regard is that when you're trying to collect CO2, and investigate the thermodynamics of it, you actually have to account for the extra energy that the exhaust provides to the overall system by virtue of capturing energy from the Sun.  IOW, a warmer atmosphere -- thanks to the added CO2 -- only enhances the mixing process, and in doing so works against our goal of re-capturing the carbon.\n\n>Do you think that people who research carbon capture whether from coal/natural gas plants or from the atmosphere are just missing this very straightforward energy argument you’re making?\n\nNo, I don't think they're missing it -- and I see the fact that, f.e., the article you linked to doesn't even touch that problem as evidence that they're not.

"A fluid flowing past a surface exerts a force on that surface, lift is the component perpendicular to fluid flow. No mechanism is specified in the definition of lift.\n\nCompression or decompression aren't important, pressure is, and water pressure absolutely changes when flowing over a surface - that's what causes hydrodynamic cavitation on propellers.\n\nMany types of sailboats depend on lift generated by a foil under the water to generate horizontal lift that counteracts sideslip generated by the lift on the sail, and allows them to sail upwind. On small boats that allow the keel or daggerboard to be removed, you'll go nowhere fast if you try it without one.",Physics

"For comparison, we could look to beta plus decay. A free proton will never decay because such a process is energetically banned, but bound inside a nucleus, this becomes possible because the energy situation has changed (the mass of the daughter nucleus is less than that of the mother, since nuclear mass is a complex function of number of protons and neutrons). So, similar idea here. The energy conditions strongly suppress or outright ban neutron decay in the star, which can also happen for various nuclei. I don't know my neutron star physics, so I can't comment on how exactly the process is suppressed--your explanation intuitively makes sense though.",Physics

"""not influenced by internal or external stimuli"", how can anything do anything if it doesn't have a reason to?\n\nIf free will is being unfettered by things like instinct (internal stimuli) that drive me to eat when I'm hungry and avoid bodily harm (external stimuli perceived as ""danger""), then an actor with free will should be just as likely to step into traffic and die as not, with the randomness of a coin flip. I think your definition of free will is insufficient.\n\nIn AI and economics there is the concept of an agent with goals. A rational agent acts to achieve some goal (win the chess game, get the car to the destination) by choosing actions, or sequences of actions, based on their perceived utility towards achieving that goal. Things in the real world have a finite perception of the options they have and the consequences of their actions, and often even a limited conscious understanding of their own goals,  easily confusing the utility measured towards towards their final goals (??) with utility towards lesser goals instrumental towards final goals (reproduction, consuming calories in preparation for hard times, etc).\n\nMillions of years of evolution and a lifetime of social conditioning have been tweaking the way species and individuals perceive and weigh their options in different situations. I think the search for ""free will"" ultimately demands a distinction without a difference and uninteresting compared to studying biology, psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology, etc.\n\nThis is a very liberal arts degree take (as my psychology and sociology education ends at the 200 level in the New York state undergraduate system), but I like Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development as a starting point for modeling and qualifying different types of actors.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development\n\nHe distinguishes the person (often as stages of life from infancy to adulthood) who only makes choices to avoid negative stimuli (punishment, hunger), with a person who acts toward some perception of right and wrong, and from there distinguishes where they get their sense of right and wrong-- does their friend group or society dictate their morals or do they have their own moral system that they would listen to over the rules society provides.\n\nIt's very simplistic and self contradictory. Like Heath Ledger's Joker could be argued to be level 2 like a pleasure seeking child as well as he could be argued to be a transcendent level 6 with his own higher moral code. But I think it's a fun place to start.",Physics

">To address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. \n\nA slight correction to this -- the CO2 doesn't really *re-emit* the photon.  Instead the absorbed photon excites the ro-vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule, effectively increasing its kinetic energy, which is then re-distributed to other molecules (such as N2, O2, H2O) in the atmosphere upon collisions, effectively leading to increased kinetic energy content (=temperature) of the atmosphere.  This difference in the process is crucial for understanding the fine details of the greenhouse effect; however, it is almost trivial at the same time, given that the black-body radiation (mostly IR for something at \~300K) of a substance is temperature-dependent.",Physics

"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",Biology

"> How do I look for groups in a specific research area?\n\nOnce you start reading papers about a specific subject, you will naturally start to recognise familiar names and places. Perhaps a good starting point if you're completely unfamiliar with the landscape of a particular subfield is to go to a Wikipedia page for a topic you're interested in, look for the sources they cite and who has recently cited those papers.\n\n> Once I know the groups which appeal to me, should I just look if they have an open PhD position? Or should I look more in general? If so, how would you suggest I look for a PhD?\n\nFrom my experience, most PhD positions in Europe are not advertised openly because there are suitable candidates inside the research group (a big exception to this are larger research centres like Max Planck institutes which have a regular rate of many PhD positions each year). My advice is to a) ask your master thesis advisor (ideally you want to do your thesis on a related subject although that's rarely a deal-breaker) and b) contact professors from research groups you're interested in early on (at least 9 to 6 months before you plan on graduating, because securing funding takes quite long and will not unlikely get you involved in writing a grant application).",Physics

Some issues to consider: how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome (not splitting important genes); ensuring regular but not too active transcription; would it lead to a sort of ""tolerance"" to the antigen, causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen.

"Disease is a big factor. New strains of viruses and bacteria appear (or change in frequency) every year, making pathogen-resistance alleles come and go as well, almost like yearly fashion trends.\n\nThere are planktonic animals that make resting stages (e.g. eggs) that sink to the bottom of the pond and can stay in suspended animations for several years. In [one classic study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06291), old resting stages of *Daphnia* (along with their pathogens) were dug out of the mud and reanimated. This is basically like using a time machine to hop back and forth and systematically cross-expose parasites and hosts from different time periods. One cool result was that the pathogens tended to be more able to infect *Daphnia* from the same year, showing that pathogens evolve to become especially good at infecting whatever genotypes are in the host population at the moment.\n\nWeather is another big factor. For species that reproduce fast, it can even change the population within a single year. There's a really cool study system of wild fruit flies in orchards in North America. The researchers working in the orchards have shown that allele frequencies change every year from spring to fall, as the weather becomes warmer and warmer, favoring genotypes that are good at living in warm conditions (the same alleles that are more common farther south, in fact). Then winter comes, and the population is ""reset"" as genotypes that are good at handling cold become favored instead. So it's easy to see how warm years and cold years would have a similar effect.",Biology

"Well if you are getting 1000 ppm O2 within a minute, you either have a fairly big leak or your O2 sensor has gone bad. Or both. The classic test for the sensor is to open up some diethylzinc in the box and see if it smokes (indicating O2 > \~10 ppm). I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire). You could maybe do a ketyl test if you have the reagents. If you have a spare O2 sensor, I would go ahead and replace the current one and see what happens.\n\nA few questions: did you turn off the gas circulation before opening the MeI, and did you purge thoroughly after it was re-sealed? MeI is going to absolutely wreck the box catalyst if you are not careful. The O2 sensor may also be sensitive to MeI - those sensors typically have a lifetime of 6 months - 2 years, but they have somewhat sensitive surfaces that can be poisoned by exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nFinal question: is the H2O also shooting up, or is it just the O2? If it is both, that points to a leak, but if it is just O2, I would suspect the sensor.",Chemistry

"ABS is not UV stable.  Chemical inhibitors are added during manufacture.\n\nWhen the plastic ages, the UV absorbers stop working and an oxygen molecule will snatch a single hydrogen atom from the plastic molecule.  The molecule then slightly re-arranges into a yellow coloured new molecule.  Overall: the plastic has irreversibly lost a small part of itself but not enough to change the size of the brick.\n\nAdding peroxide + UV introduces more even stronger radicals - BAM! kick it up a notch.  They attack the yellow polymer only at the site that is missing a hydrogen atom and essentially chop it in half. No more yellow coloured molecule.\n\nDownside is the polymer is no longer elastic.  It's brittle.  What you un-intentionally end up doing is scraping off that tiny thin brittle layer to expose fresh plastic underneath.\n\nYou can repeat the process many times so long as you have material remaining.  It's almost exactly like sandpaper over a wooden floor to expose a fresh surface.  And yes, you can do it so many times but not infinite times.  The freshly exposed surface is essentially a new brick with new UV absorbers.\n\nOverall: peroxide + UV bleaching very slightly makes the lego brick a little bit smaller.",Chemistry

"You make some fair points, but I’m a little unsure about your main argument. \n\nAre you saying that all of the energy gained from the past 100-150 years of burning fossil fuels would have to be used to capture the CO2 in the atmosphere, and that we won’t be able to generate that much energy because we will also have to be powering society with renewables? If this isn’t what you’re saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as I’m aware, I don’t think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I don’t know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldn’t be using fossil fuels for energy. I’m not a “clean coal” or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. It’s not a fixed cost for every material. I can’t tell if I’m missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we aren’t trying to “unburn the coal.” Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isn’t coal. This can be CO2 bound to amines in aqueous amine solutions or CO2 bound to some calcium compound among other things, but I don’t think the energy required for the adsorption has to be equal to the initial energy used.",Physics

Particularly interesting for me was the prize for physics and kinetic, which were related.

Using this fluid dynamics approach they showed good agreement in describing real interactions. The same group previously attempted to direct pedestrians but was not very successful \[3\], suggesting we still need to develop how to introduce external forces.\n\nThe kinetics prize \[4\] was given for investigating the effect of people on phones in crowds.

"This is wrong, as has been mentioned elsewhere.\n\nWe know a ton about DM and it is not a placeholder for anything. We know how much of it there was at the point of last scattering due to precision measurements of the CMB's temperature temperature correlation (as well as from polarization information). We also know how much there was due to measurements of the abundances of light elements. It is because these two measurements agree that we *really* believe that DM is what we think it is. But we also know its radial profile in galaxies, that it doesn't interact with regular matter much, that it doesn't interact with itself much, that it clumps, that this clumpiness dictates the large scale structure of the universe, and probably other things that I'm forgetting. All of these things point to a self consistent picture of a cold fluid that has thermally evolved like matter and has been present in corresponding densities since the very early universe.\n\nA lot of non-physicists have this idea that DM is just rotation curves and nothing else. That is *not* why we believe DM exists, although it is one more data set that points to a consistent picture, and it is the first data set pointing towards DM, but far from the most precise.\n\nAs for DE, it is also not a placeholder. We see that we have recently (a few billion years ago) entered into a DE dominated era where the evolution of the Hubble parameter is increasingly dominated by DE. The primary data set for this is type 1a SNe. While this data set is tricky, there are a large number of independent checks of DE, notably intrinsic curvature. In addition, we have looked for higher order moments in the acceleration of the universe and not found any, suggesting that DE is what we think it is. Finally, we know that the equation of state of DE is close to -1 as expected from the cosmological constant.\n\nWhat is going on right now in these areas? Many things. For DM, people are using the open data from experiments like GAIA to detect substructures in the galactic DM halo, which is mind boggilingly awesome. As for DE, with upcoming experiments like Vera Rubin we will increase our SNe data set by orders of magnitude.\n\nFinally, the dark sector mentioned in this article isn't the same as dark energy or dark matter, although it could be. Despite the fact that these names all sound related and very vague - dark sector, dark matter, dark energy - they are distinct things. The article is about neutrinos and an anomaly at 4.8sig that just got weirder: obvious explanations don't work so people are turning to less obvious things. This is the way discoveries work. Something strange happens in the data (MiniBooNE sees an excess), the simplest interpretation is investigated (a sterile neutrino), so follow up experiments are built to robustly test this. MicroBooNE just reported their first test of MiniBooNE's excess and, in a different kind of experiment, they don't see it. But the MiniBooNE result has been checked to hell and back, it is pretty hard to believe that it is just an experimental problem, although it could be. Thus people are considering new physics scenarios other than sterile neutrinos and these scenarios often go under the umbrella term of dark sector, although it's a pretty shit name just like dark matter and dark energy.",Physics

This is the exact same physical state as the football. The mass of the ball is distributed closest to the axis, so it is least likely to deviate from a spin.\n\nIf any force were to cause it to wobble, it would want to return to its its smallest moment of inertia at first, and this would be guarded by gyroscopic procession, which causes all movement parallel to the axis of rotation to occur processed 90 degrees forward along the direction of rotation. Any outside force, instead of spinning the ball, would just cause it to wobble.\n\nI hope this helps.",Physics

"He sounds really cynical and like he doesn’t believe his patients. Or that he’s already got a conclusion in mind and is out to DISPROVE NDEs. When we set out with a bias, it’s difficult to conduct experiments without bringing that bias along. \nI listened to most of the 300 episodes of a NDE podcast over the last several years. I find it fascinating because everyone’s experience is unique but they all flow very similarly. Regardless of gender, race, location, culture, or creed - people have extremely similar “spiritual” experiences when they experience an NDE or psychoactive compound. Whether it’s LSD where eyes are open, or DMT with closed eyes while seeing more vividly than ever imagined…the experiences are so strikingly similar. With DMT, why would people see the same “entities” even if they’ve never heard reference of them beforehand? I’m not saying that with DMT you go off on an astral trip and meet inter-dimensional beings. But what IS happening? HOW are our humans brains so alike that we hallucinate the exact same ridiculous looking things in an altered state? How have people completely healed themselves from addictions after “meeting Mother Auyhuasca”? How is that we can consume a substance that causes us to dig into the depths of our psyche and rearrange things so that we can function more easily and understand the world more clearly? There is insurmountable evidence if more than a few scientists would study it and if it wasn’t so damn Taboo to talk about. \n\nIt’s precisely because it’s considered woowoo that there isn’t more in-depth research on the topic or at least not that the public is allowed to know about. It’s precisely why psilocybin, DMT, LSD, and even cannabis have been deemed schedule 1 drugs. Because it usually changes the way we see the world. It usually causes us to “wake up”, from this dumb broken system we’ve created. Why does it do that? Well, we don’t really NEED to understand the why to see that it does, regardless of our understanding. But I do believe we will understand it better someday. Whatever it is, it IS scientific and it just IS the way things are. Either we as humans have the ability to hallucinate the same experiences and exact images as strangers across the globe, or it’s a spiritual experience suggesting that there is way more than just this earthly plane of existence. It’s one of those two things and they are both really freaking cool. If science helps discover the truth, and if spirituality is also the truth, then I expect in the future we will come to accept that they complement each other well. But there is no room for religion (not even the “religion” of faith in science, because it’s still done by man’s hand) when it comes to progress. \n\nObserve and wonder.

"Hirsch isn't looking to ""recreate the plots exactly.""\n\nAnd, in any case, doing so is not actually scientifically important. If there is fakery, recreating fake plots from fake raw data *does not actually test scientific truth.* (I will assume you include supplemental instructions along with the data, because the original manuscript is usually space constrained so it actually cannot give enough information to get from raw data to plots: that is the hand-holding I mean).\n\nIn a philosophical sense, there is always some faith you are placing in the provider of data that it is really the data that the instruments provided. You can't eliminate that. Sharing data is more a measure of truthful behavior in a social, behavioral sense.\n\nI already distinguished that in some cases like observational sciences it can allow some additional science when it is taken generally without respect to the model being tested. That is the case in LIGO: you assume they are capturing actual strain in space-time, and sharing the data is then useful because it wasn't collected with any particular model of neutron stars or even general relativity. So if you have a competing model for such objects, you can use that data to figure out an alternative idea for what produced it.\n\nBut in a case like Dias, the data, even if truly collected from the apparatus, can't generally tell you, for example, whether the compound in the apparatus was prepared as the manuscript says, or whether the temperature and external fields were as the manuscript says.

However, the main problem that MOND was introduced to solve has an adequate and vastly simpler alternative solution (dark matter), and these days MOND doesn't even fully solve that problem on its own and still needs some dark matter to match observations.\n\nSo, you're calling what is arguably the simplest solution to a set of real problems a ""gigantic hack"" while comparing it to a non-solution to a different problem that already has a much simpler solution.\n\nAt the end of the day, we need an actual solution to things like the horizon problem.  The phrasing you used to characterize inflation makes it sound like you would consider *any* solution to be a ""hack"" simply because it would be more complicated than current models without any solution, and that seems misguided.

"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell. Sounds counter intuitive, but that's just because writing it out in words introduces imprecisions.",Physics

"Here is a write-up I made some time back after I went through this and then had friends do so. Hope it helps!\n\nPantry moth (Indian meal moth): Plodia interpunctella. It is different from other meal moth species, including the common meal moth, Pyralis farinalis. Adults are tricolored above, wavy patterned below, and with the tiny abdomen tip held at about 90 degrees to body plane. Now pantropical (and in warm temperate regions), it may have originated in Central America.\n\nTheir diet is unusually broad, including grains and many foods made with at least some grain including cereals, breads, muffins, pasta, pet food, bird seed, but apparently also some nuts, candy bars, peanut butter, possibly starches such as corn starch, tapioca, etc.\n\nThe peak adult activity is around dusk. During daytime the adults mostly remain inactive in dark spots (e.g. crevices). Adults are moderately attracted to light, especially in the blue to violet range.\n\nThey are readily detectable using pheremone traps (scented tent-traps). Deter them by using airtight, adequate  food containers or double bagging, as well as using essential oils and nontoxic pantry moth spray. All stages including eggs are readily killed in a short time by temperatures over c. 130°F (e.g. in a car in the sun on a hot day) or freezing for 72 hours.\n\nUnlike most meal moths, the larvae of this species readily chew through paper, some plastics including processed-cereal freshness liners, and even thin cardboard. Double-bagging with Ziplock bags is normally adequate unless populations are large. Tupperware style containers only work if they completely seal (""airtight""). Put open food away promptly and avoid leaving pet food out more than a day or two.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. “\n\n[End of your quote. If you don’t feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there’s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I’ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don’t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I’ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I’m saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It’s one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you’re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I’ve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n“>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.”\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said “[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got” and then you tell me to “shut up” for saying that you said that “DAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.” I’m very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I’m this part where you quoted me I’m saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said “couldn’t be feasible” this was meant to be synonymous with “impossible” rather than “unfeasible,” then either you’ve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I’m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",Physics

"Yup, I think this might be the best observation. There are some megataxonomies of viruses that emerged prior to LUCA, and their genomes also work with the standard twenty amino acids. So, while observing that both archaea and bacteria use all twenty may show that at least LUCA used these twenty amino acids, that all viruses also use them suggests a far more primitive, probably pre-cellular adoption to the twenty amino acids.\n\nSomeone could argue that it's possible that all megataxonomies of viruses only adopted the standard twenty after LUCA and only later evolved towards the current system as a result of evolution. So, while it seems quite implausible, the argument may go that it is at least *possible* this doesn't prove viruses indicate an earlier origins of the twenty amino acids than LUCA. But it turns out that LUCAs own genome is filled with viruses that used the standard twenty amino acids. So LUCAs own virome helps confirm an earlier origins of the twenty.

"It’s hard to say because it depends on what type of plastic the bags were made of. Other ingredients include various kinds of alcohols - methanol, ethanol, propanol - we encounter these in everyday life. They all have noticeable odours; but in low concentration the vapour isn’t something to worry about. Ethanol is the alcohol we find in wine, beer and spirits, the other alcohols are not something you should drink. Propanol is in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer. Methanol is used in fuel - but methanol is poisonous. You can find it in ‘moonshine’, that home made illicit booze. Drinking it is very risky (blindness, even death). But a faint smell of methanol is not really something to worry about. If you look at page 10 of that safety data sheet, it shows the toxic limits, but it takes some interpretation. Napthalene is toxic at 250ppm (parts per million, less than the other ingredients) but napthalene is what they make mothballs out of, and people happily put them in clothes closets for decades. It’s not very volatile, but you can definitely smell it. If you’ve thrown it all away, that’s OK. If you have clothing that’s come into contact with it, or you can smell it on that clothing, just wash that clothing. Some of the chemicals in the list are the same as those you smell in over-ripe fruit like bananas. Amyl acetate is used to make flavourings and scents. Most of these compounds won’t hurt you unless you breathe the vapours in high concentrations for long periods. Speaking for myself (and having worked in labs where we used chemicals like this) I wouldn’t be worried.

"As someone else mentioned, yeah, it's the weak interaction that's weird in this way, not neutrinos. And since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction (or a component with a weak interaction) it has very weird consequences with how particles gain mass.\n\nIn principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and they'd just add up to the physical mass that we observe. And there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the Lagrangian (the Lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff). You just write m \* psibar \* psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particle's mass. But because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side, such a term is forbidden. Peter Higgs, and others, realized the solution to this: let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be non-zero everywhere. This gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way, but also respects the left handedness of particles. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality works.\n\nWith neutrinos its even weirder, but I'm getting pretty far off point.",Physics

"As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved. You might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a PTFE stirbar on a hotplate. In the plant, it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer. All of the changes you make to scale up- more powerful mixers, bigger pumps, larger diameter pipes and hoses, can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale. A big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact, particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets, has the potential to leach into your product, or catalyze degradation, or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab.",Chemistry

Peanut butter, for instance, is a carcinogen but 40 tablespoons of peanut butter has the same cancer risk as a single cigarette. And it’s all risk, there isn’t a guarantee that anything will for sure cause cancer. But a single drop of nail polish on your bedsheet is really not enough of a cancer risk to even blink at.

As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off.

"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology
"Thats dope.\n\nI always loved the unrealistic approach of string theory and quantum physics being attached to eachother by sound.\n\nIf two particles act like that, maybe there is a frequency that is causing them to move the same way.

"Pressure building up in the bottle as the air inside it warms up. This is a fundamental behaviour of all materials. It’s especially pronounced in gasses and fluids since their molecules aren’t stuck together like solids.\n\nWe can express this as the ideal gas law\n\n(Pressure) x (Volume of container) = (amount of gas) x (Conversion ratio) x (Temperature). \n\nSince the amount of air isn’t changing, and the volume of container isn’t either, change to temperature has a directly proportional effect on the pressure of the bottle.\n\nEventually the pressure overcomes the weight of the lid, and latch.\n\nIt then equalizes pressure, gas leaves the system, and the lid falls, closing.\n\nActually similar to how the coolant in your car engine gets distributed. There is a flow regulator they call a thermostat that as it gets warmer it expands and lets through more coolant starting at some designated temp. If it gets cool it provides less coolant. It’s a self regulating system, and how your car engine always stays at the same temp once it’s heated up.",Physics

"I can attest from personal experience it is impossible to ride with more than a small amount of weight. I'm sure many a child has figured out the hard way that letting go of the handlebars while an external force is acting on them (such as wind, a bag of groceries, or a dog leash) is an extremely bad idea. The precise effect depends on the bicycle geometry - the fork angle, wheel offset, handlebar width, handle bar offset from the axis of steering, the rider's weight and position. For example shorter handlebar offsets causes lateral loads to contribute more to leaning the bike, whereas longer offsets causes the load to produce more steer and offset the weight from the steering axis considerably. The tire's trail affects how the bike handles at a given steer and lean angle. Most of the time though, the slackened steering produces a reversed castor wheel effect, a bag of groceries on one side will mostly tend to just steer very severely that direction in an attempt to reach the local minima of the slanted steering axis. Depending on the exact geometry, skill, weight, etc it's possible to just no-hands around in a circle with a weight on one bar, where the steering force is counteracted by the centripetal normal force, as that weight is directly analogous to a rider applying the same load with their hands to enter a turn, however this represents a singular self-stable state. If the bag is swinging around dramatically from the unsteadiness it would produce, you now have this crazy double-pendulum chaotic system. The question gets more interesting when you add a dog leash to the equation, as the force can now act along angles that the bike was not designed to self-stabilize against. The leash can be pulling out of a turn while the bike is attempting to steer into it which can cause sudden inversions in the force vectors along an unexpected axis, leading to undesireable behavior such as the wheel suddenly being oversteered, or the bike leaning out of a turn while steering into it. One can easily experiment with this unusual dynamic system with just two bikes - by riding one and pushing another beside yourself by the handlebars, you can feel how changing the position of your hand on the bar changes how the driving, slowing, banking, and steering forces all get mixed up.",Physics

"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years.

And, yes, hydrocarbons have been awesome for rocketing humanity into the 21st century. But we aren't changing today. We know. We know what is happening to our planet, the science is solid and incontrovertible. And yet, our carbon production is growing every year. This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there. I wonder sometimes if articles like this aren't mostly posted by the paid corporate trolls of the carbon producing energy companies.

For the record, I have a M.S. in chemistry and the idea of a shorter PhD sounds appealing to me, especially given that I just entered my 30s.

For the record, I am interested in Eth Zurich, schools in Germany and the UK, and am passionate about organic chemistry and multi-step synthesis. I have been in industry for a few years after obtaining my master's, however I have no publications, at least, the material may not be published for a few more years (my former advisor is slow to publish and has a record of taking 5 years after graduation to publish a work). I am curious if anyone has ever made that leap from the States to Europeans schools. I have seen a number of fantastic professors that have interesting research that I would love to apply to be a PhD student in their labs, however I am unsure of the tenability, especially in terms of pre-earmarked budget, cost of living, expenses, resident requirements, resident requirements/fees, taxes, and even covid regulations. I am also unsure of what work culture is like in Europe. I have heard hear-say that Germany and Switzerland have student unions to push back on advisors and their requirements for PhD students to work 50-80 hours a week; that the work life balance for PhD candidates is actually a lot better than in the US. That sounds like a dream and another motivating factor that makes me interested.  \n  \nHas anyone made that leap? If so, would you care to comment?

"Honestly there are a few other factors.  Most heat will be transferred through actual diffusion of air, not just conduction through window pane glass.  So if you have a lot of airflow, that will increase the rate of stabilizing the temperature (outside and inside being the same temperature). The only way that curtains will help is by blocking airflow to the window where conduction or diffusion (air escaping through tiny gaps) will happen.  But you could achieve a similar effect with something transparent (shower curtains honestly would be more than enough and prevent a decent amount of conduction).\n\nThe sun's radiated heat can be a huge factor in warming an area.  I would try to make sure you allow in as much of that heat as you can.",Physics
"If by expired you just mean outlasts its sell-by or use-by date, but is still sealed up inside the bottle or can, then probably not much. If the seal is still good and no air can get in, then there won't be much decomposition in most cases.\n\nThe exceptions will be certain wines or beers which still contain some live yeasts - you can tell which ones these are because there will be some visible sediment at the bottom of the bottle. These also tend to have shorter dates on them, because they can go bad much quicker. The temperature of storage also makes a big difference to these - if kept refrigerated they will probably outlast their dates, if kept in a warm storage room they likely won't. Anyway, the active yeast will be slowly consuming any sugars still present in the drink, the rate depending on temperature. So the drink will eventually end up very dry, sour and probably somewhat over-carbonated - if the bottle hasn't exploded by that time!\n\nFor the other category you mentioned where the drink is exposed to the air, it depends on what the alcohol content starts at. For spirits, they will at first lose alcohol by evaporation, until the percentage by volume drops to a level where bacteria can actually survive in the solution. From that point, bacteria will start to grow, including the type which metabolise alcohol into acetic acid.\n\nFor wines and beers, the bacterial contamination will begin much more quickly (within days) if open to the air. So again, bacteria will start to grow, and the alcohol content will start being converted into acetic acid, forming vinegar. If enough bacteria grow, you can end up with a slimy layer on the top, which is a combination of the bacteria themselves and their other metabolic products, one of which is cellulose, which forms the slime or jelly-like substance, known in the brewing trade as ""mother of vinegar"". The reason it has this name is that you can take a piece of this and add it to any other wine or beer and it will kick-start the vinegar production at an accelerated rate.\n\nIf you want a vinegar acceptable for use as a condiment or in cooking, then you ideally want an acetic acid content somewhere between 3 and 6 %, and a residual alcohol content between 0.5 and 1 %. If the bacterial fermentation is allowed to continue until all the alcohol is consumed, then different bacteria take over which start consuming the acetic acid. They will then carry on doing that until all the acetic acid is gone too, and then you will be left with basically water with a lot of dead bacteria in it. This may subsequently grow mould, but it would be useless long before it got that far.",Chemistry

The important bit here is that there is some greater force holding the cap down above and beyond just gravity pulling it down. It could be it's a tight fit or maybe even just surface tension of water where the cap contacts the lid. This results in a periodic phenomenon where expanding gas inside finally breaches the breaking force of the cap and then immediately depressurizes the container. Then the cap comes slamming down. The process repeats as the gas inside continues to expand.,Physics

"The entangling operation in ions is very slow. I think the world record for it is a few microseconds.  It's not a simple transition that you can drive quickly with a laser.  Remember that the entangled operation (like a CNOT)  involves two ions, not a single ion, and the entanglement is very fragile.  Superconducting qubits and quantum dots can be driven very quickly, with entanglement taking nanoseconds.  But ions are slow and many ion schemes involve actually physically moving the ions, which also takes time if you want to avoid destroying the entanglement. \n\nIons are still a very useful system for learning about quantum computing but I don't think there is much expectation that they will scale to useful computations.",Physics

"Looks like an assassin bug!\nThe wheel bug, Arilus cristatus, is North Carolina’s largest assassin bug. It gets its name from the prominent spiny “wheel” found on the thorax. Both nymphs and adults are generalist predators that feed on a variety of insects including aphids, caterpillars, bugs, beetles, and more. The bug uses its stout beak to inject the prey insect with a toxin that kills it within 30 seconds. Most of their prey are pest insects so they are considered beneficial to farmers and gardeners. They move slowly and are clumsy fliers. Their bite has been described as being more painful than a wasp sting so they should be admired but not handled\n\nRead more at: https://growingsmallfarms.ces.ncsu.edu/2020/04/birth-assassin-bug/",Biology

"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years. If someday in the deep unexplored ocean some decendant of [*Anomalocaris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris) was found, it would be the coolest thing, but it wouldn't change current evolutionary theory.",Biology

"I'll disagree with saying dopamine is ""the cause"" of addiction. Here's my view. Addiction is a lock and key. If you gave Adderall to a large random sample some would hate it, some would not. Some fraction would be more mentally effective but not addicted, and some would become addicted regardless of any pharmacological benefit.\n\nAn example: I was on morphine for about 2 weeks after serious surgery when I was in my early 20s. I was taken off of it fairly suddenly when I went home. I had physical withdrawal but didn't realize it, and called my doctor with ""odd"" symptoms. He literally laughed on the phone but didn't say why, and gave me a prescription for a tranquilizer for a week or two. A few days later a friend explained it. So, did I crave opiates when I went off, or after I found out what happened? No. Would I have considered it taking it if I could somehow get it free and safely? Not even a little. I have a life to lead, thank you. What about years later when I went through chronic depression and had had personal experience or familiarity with more addictive things? No, never called to me. Does that make me better than an addict? Absolutely not, just lucky in that particular way. \n\nAs a baseline (possibly genetic), most people have very low to moderately low vulnerability to addiction, but more is fairly common. If someone with significant baseline potential is in a situation of chronic pain, either physical or emotional, their vulnerability goes up rapidly in proportion to the pain.\n\nEmotional pain can be things people don't even realize is pain because they've normalized it. Low self esteem, a bad marriage, a sense of failure, a phobia or chronic anxiety, fear about a large scale issue like climate change, or chronic hate (at the government, women, themselves, or whatever).\n\nWhy have addiction rates skyrocketed in the US? You don't have to be anyplace on the political spectrum, and barely awake, to know the problem. Suicide and crime rates skyrocketing. Obesity and diabetes skyrocketing. People hate social media and use it more than ever. Ever larger corporations and no privacy. The country has been gradually tearing itself apart more and more.\n\nThere is one and only one trigger for addiction rates climbing ever since The US Vietnam War and 60's social strife, up through the (current) pandemic and strife. One trigger: increasing chronic, individual pain. Any coincidence that the steepest climb in addictions lately is in pain medication? I think not.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

We know that dark matter does not interact that way as there would be a huge number of 511 keV x-rays which are not seen. We also know that the dark matter self-interaction is not too large which is inconsistent with known dark matter properties. We also know that dark matter is largely invisible (does not interact with light) while anti-matter does interact with light exactly the same amount as regular matter.,Physics

Then reversing the time,  you find that the transformation time is swapped.\n\nMore concretely, let A to B transformation takes X time but B to A transformation takes Y time when played forward in time.  Now, if you see a recording and find that B changes to A in X time, you know that recording is played backward in time.  You have just broken time-symmetry since you can determine if the recording is played forward or backward in time. \n\nOf course, as others mentioned.

"The vaccine mRNA particles won’t have traveled to your baby via breast milk. In fact, the mRNA didn’t even circulate through your wife’s whole body.

These can pass via breast milk to your baby and induce the same inflammatory reactions in your child’s body.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people are also talking about passing antibodies via breast milk. This can occur, but only IgA antibodies. IgA is secreted in our mucosal surfaces to neutralize incoming pathogens in our mouths, lungs, GI tract, etc. However, vaccines predominantly cause an IgM and IgG response.

"O2 slowly going up when the blower is off is fairly normal. All boxes have a nonzero leak rate, but the catalyst can handle it as long as the air is circulating through it. In addition, the O2 sensor can be less accurate when the blower is off because their readings are sensitive to the gas flow around them.\n\nDoes the O2 only go up when the blower is on? I had a very similar problem in grad school. The issue turned out to be a problem in the regeneration line - the exhaust solenoid had an obstruction, and so it was always open. As a result oxygen could sneak in through the exhaust line and into the catalyst, but would only be able to get into the box and the sensors when air was circulating through the catalyst. I would check for leaks / flow problems in your regeneration line.",Chemistry

"Yeah, that’s what I was mainly talking about too. Did you read my post past the first example? It applies about the same for flue streams as it does to atmospheric CO2, which is why I brought it up. The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. \n\n(If you just feel like skimming the rest of this, see the paragraphs I say are the most important one. It provides links to journal articles which directly address what thermodynamic processes are important in determining the limits of direct air capture. One passage from one of the journal articles directly addresses and contradicts your claim.)\n\nDo you think that people who research carbon capture whether from coal/natural gas plants or from the atmosphere are just missing this very straightforward energy argument you’re making? Process chemistry analysis of the feasibility of carbon capture is done on all of these different capture environments. Have these people missed out on the apparent massive flaw in direct air capture? If you read such a paper, it even talks about energy requirements and related concerns for carbon capture. A conclusion you won’t find in this analysis is that “carbon capture is pointless because the energy required to capture the carbon is too high.” You can read this article (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2020.00092/full). Note the following quotation “Based on these studies, DAC is currently considered as an energy-intensive and costly approach for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, researchers believe that the high cost and energy consumption in such systems are mostly due to the immaturity of the technology, and hence DAC may be eventually considered as a viable option for removing CO2 from the atmosphere.” There’s no suggestion that DAC is futile because of thermodynamics restrictions. Perhaps you have a reservation about this journal (I know it’s maybe a little controversial - my main experience with it has been with a very high quality review article I read in it on a different topic though), in which case I’m sure you can find other articles on this topic in other journals, although the corresponding author’s google scholar looks legitimate enough. \n\n(These next 2 paragraphs are the most important part of my reply)\n\nYou can also check out (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00173) which is a very well cited review on direct air capture. They even have a thermodynamics section toward the end. Note that they even mention the second law of thermodynamics, but the process they are applying it to is CO2 binding to the adsorbent and then having it unbind. Citation 28 of that paper directly addresses a theoretical lower bound for the energy requirements in section 2.1. Here’s a link for a pdf of it. (https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00003926/document) The paragraphs at the start of section 2 explain how the relevant thermodynamic process doesn’t involve whatever it was that initially put the CO2 there, but rather have to do with adsorption and desorption from the material. Note how they don’t even mention the source of the CO2 in the atmosphere. \n\nThat article in citation 28 even has this quotation “The ∼4 GJ/tC minimum may be compared to the carbon-specific energy content of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas have about 40, 50, and 70 GJ/tC respectively. Thus if the energy for air capture is provided by fossil fuels then the amount of carbon captured from the air can—in principle—be much larger than the carbon content of the fuel used to capture it. The fuel carbon can, of course, be captured as part of the process rather than being emitted to the air.” This directly shows that your claim is incorrect. \n\nI’m not trying to be argumentative for its own sake; your claim sounded intuitive enough that I figured people might read it, think it sounded right, and then move on with a very misinformed opinion on direct air capture. In another thread on this subreddit I even saw a similar claim to the one you made being made, so it seems like others find this type of argument compelling, but I’m not sure where it’s coming from. \n\nRegarding your other point, I don’t understand why the main thing you responded to had to do with the greenhouse effect either. Obviously CO2 is a greenhouse gas. My point was that the CO2 that gets captured may or may not be in an excited vibrational state when it gets captured. Ultimately, it doesn’t even matter for the rest of the argument though. The 2 main paragraphs above show that your thermodynamic argument is incorrect with peer-reviewed journal articles.",Physics

If we look at a point at the bottom, the mass of rope applying tension is much less. Again, if we look at the forces applied to a single point on the rope we can see at the top the tension vector is very long in the negative direction in comparison to the horizontal force of the wind. The sum of those vectors faces almost completely down. As we continue to do so further down the rope we see the tension decreases and the ratio of that tension vector in comparison to the horizontal air force vector decreases and the total force vector points more in the direction of the horizontal force.",Physics

"The long answer to your question would be that your terms need to be properly defined. The short answer is maybe.\n\nThere are two distinct types of empathy: cognitive empathy, which is similar to theory of mind, the ability to understand how others think and feel. The second is affective empathy, which is sharing the physical experience of somebody else’s emotions. So, if somebody is feeling nervous, somebody high in affective empathy would also feel nervous. These are distinct traits. However, being high in either doesn’t necessarily mean you’re compassionate. Somebody could have high cognitive empathy, and just not care how others feel, or can justify their reasons for hurting others, or are supported by cultural norms or beliefs. Somebody with affective empathy might be overcome by their emotions to the point that they’re not able to be compassionate because they’re overwhelmed.\n\nFurthermore, the trouble with compassion is that we are not equally compassionate to all people in all contexts. I recall something from Sapolsky’s ‘Behave’ about women who have stronger ‘in groups’ display more empathy among each other, but show equal fear and disdain of out groups. So those who are more empathetic to their friends, are also less empathetic to strangers. Should we call that person ‘high empathy’ or ‘low empathy’? Neither seems to fit and the label is meaningless without the understanding of the context.\n\nSo, the question is kind of unanswerable because its too general. Studies of human behaviour are only meaningful within the context of the study and can’t be easily extrapolated.\n\nIn common parlance, ‘empathy’ is just a pseudoscience term for being a nice person. But, what is ‘nice’ is culturally relative and dependant on who we’re meant to be ‘nice’ to.",Biology

Realistically, you never get clothing back from a dry cleaner that is still wet with solvent or coated in a magic invisible layer of protective chemicals.\n\nSome fabric materials do decompose over time.

Those decomposition products can react with water to release very astringent sulfur or acid compounds.\n\nThe clothing may have contained mold and you had a allergic reaction to some of the decomposition products.  Best way to describe it is smelly very bitter and sharp.\n\nThe other culprit is usually decaying skin and body oils.  Those smell like rancid oils.  It's the slightly off-smell you get in vintage stores.  Sometimes it's stronger than others and you need a strong mechanical thrashing to remove it.\n\nOverall: agree with everyone else.

"$100 per tonne would be reasonable in terms of the cost of a carbon credit (denominated in 1t). Not absurdly cheap, but apparently below the figure used for planning by some major companies, so this could be economically viable. \n\nThe problem is where the energy comes from. There are three possible answers that I can think of: \n\n1. They have just ignored this problem. Sounds stupid, but I have come across a company with a different technology who just thought that they had to improve their tech and put in more energy scavenging to break even.\n\n2. They are only reconstituting carbon, whereas most fossil fuels are hydrocarbon. It could be that they are banking on the extra energy from the hydrogen part of the combustion. Unlikely, because the Carnot limit would probably still leave a power plant operating at a loss. \n\n3.  This is not aimed at power plants, but at things like cement factories which also produce CO2. In which case they may assume that the power is produced externally (nuclear or renewable) and that this is a way to mitigate CO2\nproduction which would happen anyway. In this case there is no need for the power budget to match.",Physics
"I think the emergent property argument, at least as I’ve heard Sean Carroll say in other contexts, is something similar to how physicists view emergent properties in statistical mechanics. That is to say, there is no such thing as the temperature of a single atom, nor the pressure of a single atom, but rather these macroscopic properties (of a gas, say) can be very accurately modeled as emerging from the many trillions of well-understood kinetic collisions of those atoms. In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we’ve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don’t fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology

"Why would this be a process you attempt in situ? You're telling me you'll design an entirely new nuclear reactor based entirely on the idea that it might maybe form something somewhat beneficial? I mean, you're talking about introducing a fuel rod, a reflector and a gas  into a reactor. Just with fuel rod and reflector, you would at a minimum need to completely overhaul a reactor to swap it out to your newly designed fuel rod and reflector. Plus you'd need to introduce a gas stream into the system which gets very complicated. Cooling efficiency would change dramatically... so... I really don't see any other option than complete redesign. I'm also not sure what you're doing about cladding. Every fuel rod I know of is encased in a cladding material that would prevent the formation of the uranium nitride you want since that uranium is not exposed to the NH3. I'm willing to bet that a basic solution is not ideal for the system, either. \n\nI don't know the decay chains of everything so I'll just take your word that a neutron will create 15-N. Presumably that will be most efficient at a certain neutron velocity so why wouldn't you take a nitrogen source to something like a spallation neutron source or just another reactor (there's a few designed as neutron sources) where you can convert it to 15-N with significantly higher efficiency? Plus then you're designing a reactor around a known advancement rather than around something that might maybe create that advancement.",Chemistry

I had several samples of ascorbic acid ( new, opened for week, opened for 3 months, and opened for more than  a year). I used titration method using DCPIP to found out if there are any changes. Firstly, the results show that there is more ascorbic acid than I actually used (I made a solution using 0.1g of ascorbic acid and 500ml of water, all the results show that there was more than 0.1g used which I can't explain. Secondly, I have repeated the experiment 4x and there is always an significant outlier. Also, I was doing the titration very precisely, but in some of the samples I had difficultly to find concordant titres.  Lastly, most of the results show that the older samples have more ascorbic acid in them than the new ones. I don't understand what's going on and I can't explain the results.

The solution should be quite concentrated. You'll get a dark green solution of the Ti(III) complex. Let a few drops of this solution evaporate on a clean surface, while the blower is turned on. If you get a green residue after the toluene evaporates, your atmosphere has only a few ppm of O2 at most and I would point to your O2 detector being the problem here.

Then the lid would lift slightly, pressure would equalize and the process would restart.\n\nIf it's surface tension or a clipping mechanism, the pressure would build up to a level higher than what is needed to just lift the lid a bit.

At this point the resisting force would disappear altogether, and the build up pressure would lift the lid in a more explosive manner, as we see.",Physics

The vast majority of the physics we know today comes from experimental data analysis first.\n\nThis doesn't mean that we only add random parameters but the first stage in writing new physics is describing the phenomenon and make the math work. Then afterwards you can prove a more comprehensive theory that gives you the intial explanation as a result and that hopefully has some observable aspects that can help you verify it is actually correct.\n\nThis is not a ""new"" thing, the evolution from just describing motion to Newtonian physics to only afterwards the Hamiltonian equation is an example. Or Bohr and Planck ""inventing"" discrete energy and angular momentum before quantum mechanics was a thing to explain some experiments.\n\nAnd after you've done all this you still have to verify with experiments that you theory is correct. You could potentially have you hundreds of different theories that all give you the known physics as limit cases but still are fundamentally different, you can't just choose one unless it is able to predict something you can't already explain. And right now that's difficult because experiments going beyond the known phenomenons would cost trillion of dollars.

It will kill you by other means far before it eats away bones.\n\nSide note: I had a colleague in grad school spill some LiPF6 on her hand while making a test battery and had some subsequent severe irritation on her skin.

Liquid nitrogen is supplied out of this tank, from an outlet at the bottom of the tank. No pump, just liquid decant/gravity fed out. I understand the liquid at the outlet is subject to a force according to the height of liquid above it (and density, gravity). \n\n- To what degree does the 1000kpa of pressure in the vapour space affect the liquid that is 'pushed out' the bottom outlet? Does this pressure apply a force on liquid below the surface at all? \n- if we consider the liquid level height and the vapour pressure as variables, which will be a more significant factor in how 'quickly', or with how much force the liquid is pushed out the bottom?\n\nIt's been a few years since uni and I'm trying to wrap my head around it.

I tried to calculate the liquid height force (rho*g*h) and compare to the force due to pressure of the gas, but the gas pressure came out much larger lol.\n\nIs it simply that the vapour pressure only acts on the surface boundary and below that the 'pressure' on the liquid is due to the liquid height?\n\nThanks!!",Physics

"In quantum field theory (which we know to work pretty damn well), in principle there are certain processes that are allowed to happen. Those processes are called ""Charge-Parity symmetry violating"". There's one parameter (called Θ) in our equations that determines how frequent those processes should occur, and this is something we have to measure experimentally and cannot derive theoretically, just like the masses of particles, their charges or how strong certain interactions are.\n\nAnd we experimentally find that those processes...have never occured once since we started looking for them in the 70's. So, it's pretty plausible that the parameter Θ is zero. We can't know for sure, though, and it could also be super super tiny.\n\nWell, it turns out that if this parameter Θ isn't just a fixed number, but another quantum mechanical field, then it would automatically cause those processes to never occur. Of course, this is a slightly more complex mechanism (replacing a number with a field), but it would work perfectly - and this is basically what we also did with particle masses. Before we treated them as pure numbers, but then Higgs came up with the idea that those might be caused by a field. And every field comes with a particle attached to it, and as you might have heard, we found that Higgs-particle.\n\nSo, if there is a field for our parameter Θ, then this also comes with another particle, and this is the axion. The existence of this particle would immediatly solve our original problem of possible processes never occuring, it would also be very, very light and have all the properties we need for a dark matter particle. And us cosmologists need dark matter to explain a lot about the universe - there seems to be a lot more mass in the universe than we can find. And we notice this lack of mass in many, many different scenarios.\n\nThe axion could easily solve two of the biggest outstanding problems in physics, the strong CP problem and the dark matter problem. And it comes as natural as the Higgs-mechanism. It's almost too good to be true.",Physics

You can remove all the psychoactive chemicals by boiling it in several changes of water which will make it edible, this process has been used by many indigenous tribes and I believe was also done by people in Russia. My friend likes to make a mead with the water of boiled amanita muscaria which he calls dwarves wine. I find it produces a much different effect than any other ""magic mushroom"" as the psychoactive chemicals are different. Less ""trippy"" and more ""stoney"" if that makes any sense. I still would exercise caution when consuming it and start with a small dose. I'm sure you can find a good guide to prepare on the internet, maybe try shroomery.org",Biology

The force he experiences upon hitting the ground depends on the time it takes him to come to a full stop.

"So the glucose we get from gluconeogenesis and eating food will be exactly the same in structure, however the function of the glucose at any point in time might differ to suit the body’s current needs. Gluconeogenesis only occurs when you are low on fuel. (Hungry)\n\nIf hungry —> glucose is broken down for energy\n\nIf not hungry —> glucose is converted to fuel-storage molecules.\n\n\nEXPLANATION: \n\nWhen you eat a meal but are not starving, your body is not short of energy, so the food you eat won’t be broken down to produce energy as it would basically be wasted (it’s more complicated but is sufficient to explain my point). Instead, the body converts the glucose into fuel-storage molecules such as glycogen and fat to give the body an emergency fuel source.\n\nHowever, when you are starving, your body is low on glucose. The body needs to maintain a steady glucose concentration for survival, so it produces glucose by gluconeogenesis. This glucose has a different function than the glucose we ingest because in this case, we are starving and need fuel to survive. So instead, the glucose is broken down to produce energy for the body.",Biology

"As a chemistry the advice I always give in my office hours is to solve equation based problems in the reverse of how the solutions are shown in class.\n\nStart by figuring out what the question is asking for as the answer. Then start solving from an equation that has that value in it. (Early on in chemistry there will be only one or two equations that you know with the target variable, so it's a safe starting point) \n\nNext go stepwise through that equation and for each variable see if it's given to you directly by the problem. \n\nFor the remaining variables not given directly in the problem, find another equation that has that variable in it, and substitute that into the original equation.\n\nthen repeat going step twice through that new addition equation identifying which variables are given to you in the problem. Repeat for all unknown variables. If you sub in an equation and pretty much everything in it is not given to the problem try a different equation.\n\nI recommend not putting any numbers in until the very end. Keep the whole thing as an alphabet soup. You'll get lots of partial credit that way even if you mess up. Then for the very last step, show each number that you sub in and solve for the value of the variable the problem is asking for. This makes it much much easier for someone grading to follow what you did.",Chemistry

The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> …According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world.

"From Wikipedia:\n\nIn general, glycerophospholipids use a ""sn"" notation, which stands for stereospecific numbering.[5] When the letters ""sn"" appear in the nomenclature, by convention the hydroxyl group of the second carbon of glycerol (2-sn) is on the left on a Fischer projection. The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being 1-sn the carbon at the top and 3-sn the one at the bottom.\n\nThe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration (D or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.\n\nFor example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.\n\nMost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or 3-sn position.[5] Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2-sn, with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or sn3 position.[5]",Chemistry

"Could you elaborate more on your second law of thermodynamics claim? And also more broadly why you think the energy required to capture carbon must be greater than or equal to the energy we gained from it initially. After looking more into it, I’m a little more skeptical. \n\nYou can see here (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=73&t=11) that different sources produce different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same amount of energy produced. When climeworks or anyone else captures CO2, there will be a fixed energy cost. It won’t vary based on whether the CO2 being captured came from burning coal or natural gas or from some natural process. All of these will generate CO2 with different amounts of energy produced. Like I said before, carbon capture isn’t trying to reverse the initial carbon emission process. The CO2 ends up bound in a different molecule or solid than it initially was before it was emitted. In fact, when gas phase CO2 binds to a typical adsorbent, it is energetically favored for the CO2 to be bound, so that energy will be released in the form of heat. This heating up of the material upon CO2 adsorption is actually problematic sometimes since the heat has to be dissipated for more CO2 to bind, depending on the way CO2 binds to the material. \n\nIn this type of adsorbing set up, the main energy cost is associated with desorption of the CO2. The energy inputted to desorb the CO2 is completely independent of the energy gained when the coal or oil was burned. The energy needed to desorb the bound CO2 depends only on the specifics of the adsorbing materials, and we are capable of generating materials with a large range of adsorption enthalpies.",Physics

"This is a new proposal, fresh on the arXiv today, from a group of U.S. particle physicists. The introduction is very readable and lays out the mission clearly:\n\n> We can now confidently claim that the “Standard Model” of particle physics (SM) is established. At the same time, we are more and more strongly persuaded that this SM is incomplete. [...] It is now common to describe the SM as an “effective” theory that should be derived from some more fundamental theory at higher energies. But we have almost no evidence on the properties of that theory.\n\n> Our successes have become a liability in reaching this goal. Scientists from other fields now have the impression that particle physics is a finished subject. They question our motivations to go on to explore still higher energies. The scale of an energy frontier collider is also challenging to the young people in our field. They need to see qualitatively new capabilities realized during their active scientific careers. [...] That is where the urgency lies.\n\n> [T]he entire C3 program could be sited in the United States. With the cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider and the end of Tevatron operations the US has largely abandoned construction of domestic accelerators at the energy frontier. C3 offers the opportunity to realize an affordable energy frontier facility in the US. This may be crucial to realize a Higgs factory in the near term, and it will also position the US to lead the drive to the next, higher energy stage of exploration.\n\nThe main innovation is that they propose to use _non_-superconducting cavities, which allow much higher accelerating fields, cooled to increase their quality factor. The resulting shorter length dramatically decreases the cost, to an estimated $4 billion, which is 80% to 90% less than other proposals. Of course, $4 billion is no small amount of money, but for perspective that's about equal to the monthly budget of the National Institutes of Health, a third of the cost of the James Webb Space Telescope, or 2% of the total cost of the space shuttle.",Physics

"For a solution, concentration is just how much of your solute you have per unit volume. \n\nFor a solution, purity would be how much of the sample that isn't your solvent is your solute of interest (as opposed to something else).  \n\nFor a solution, these calculations are not the same and require different information.\n\nFor a pure substance, ""concentration"" is likely not a useful metric and would just calculate purity",Chemistry

"1. Homework questions don't belong here, see the sidebar.\n\n2. If you cheat on your homework you'll never pass the tests and you certainly won't do well in future courses. If you are struggling with the homework assignments talk with your peers, talk with any graduate students and/or TAs who are around, talk with your professor.

"I disagree. He was harsh and opinionated, but laid all his cards on the table and showed receipts. There’s no more he can do; Nature, NSF, and Dias have the ball in their court. If he’s wrong, all it takes is showing the data. Every day that doesn’t happen makes the CSH results look more shaky.",Physics
" Is H2S what produced when the egg protein is being denatured? Then titration with a basic solution like NaOH would allow me to determine the amount of H2S, hence the amount of denatured protein. Is my thinking correct? It's a school lab so I don't have access to other fancy equipments :/",Chemistry
"You're correct, what's the confusion? Magnetic force equals to Bqv, and the electric force, acting upwards due to the charge of the electron, is qE (assuming uniform electric field). Since net force is 0, Bv=E, hence E/B=v.",Physics

Well generally speaking it isnt even a good advice its just saying doing a PhD in chemistry is worthless because you would be better of with anything. \n\nI cant say that he is right or wrong as i recently finished my masters degree in chemistry. As far as i can tell you still have very good job chances with a PhD way better then just with a bsc and sometimes better then with a msc :)\n\nThe main problem with that comment is that it is generally negative and the commenter does not answer why nor provides help/ressources for such a strong opinion :)\n\nEdit: didnt read the low-hanging fruits part which is really interesting - to be a bit euphemistic  :),Chemistry

"It may depend on exactly what “sterile neutrino” hypothesis you’re talking about, but I believe in the context of neutrino oscillations, adding a heavy mass state to induce changing flavors also necessitates the addition of a new flavor state. \n\nAll of the “active” neutrino states are left-chiral. If we see a regular (not-anti) neutrino that is right chiral, it’s not likely that it’s just a different state of the electron/muon/tau neutrino - it’s likely to be something entirely new, corresponding to the higher mass state.\n\n(I’ll also say I do astrophysics, not purely particle physics, so someone can definitely add to anything I’ve put here)",Physics
